    "3. ***reviewBody*** -- a string.  Text of the review.   Note that although empty reviews on Amazon are possible, you will not index them\n",
    "4. ***reviewDate*** -- a date.  The web page has a string for the date which must be parsable into a SOLR date\n",
    "5. ***reviewScore*** -- an integer.  The value must be between 1 and 5 inclusive\n",

The output of this function is an array of JSON objects, each containing data for a single review.  Note that there may be more than one JSON object produced for a file (if the product has multiple reviews) or no objects (if the product on the page has no reviews).  \n",

    "\n",
    "You might notice in looking at product names, that the name often contains *VHS* or *DVD* and in a few cases *Region 2* or similar strings, all of which are not part of the product name, but rather are about the format of the product.  These are thought to be distracting in the search context, so they should not appear in the product name and should not be indexed for search.  Keeping terms like VHS or DVD in the review summary or body is fine.  Since you want to omit VHS or DVD from the *field text* rather than just omitting it from the index, you will have to make this transformation in code prior to indexing the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you are feeling ambitious and you look at all the product names, you will notice that in a very few cases, simply removing *VHS* or *DVD* or *Region d* results in an ugly product name string.  It is acceptable to leave the few edge cases as they are, but wouldn't it be so much better to come up with a transformation that would work for them too?)"
