A few of the songs were on a 1982 sampler LP from the record company (IRS) but with a total of 22 tracks it is an extravaganza of early songs by many new wave bands. Rather than list songs, the groups are enough to ensure any 80s post-punk and new wave fan it is worth it\\'s price. Groups:  The Police, The Go Gos, Wayne County and the Electric Chairs, Wazmo Nariz, Root Boy Slim, Skafish, John Cale, Oingo Boingo (only a lad), Klark Kent (Stewart Copeland before he founded The Police), Buzzcocks, English Beat, Cramps, Magazine, Wall of Voodoo (Mexican radio), The Alarm,, R.E.M., Dr. and the Medics, Lords of the new Church, Timbuk 3, Fine Young Cannibals, Caterwaul, and Concrete Blonde. See, I told you the list was very inclusive of the period. Not very many songs are \"faves\" but some were very familiar from other groups.If you want a good intro to the late 70s and the new wave scene, enjoy.

       "  'reviewText': \"A Star Called Henry is probably far more accurate in its portrayal of Ireland in the last years of British rule than many would realise. The activities of the members of Michael Collins' &quot;Squad&quot; were much  like those performed by Henry Smart, who was, in the novel, on the  periphery of possibly the most effective counter-intellegence agency in the  world.  Roddy Doyle's excellent novel captures the period as well as  anything I have hitherto read on the subject. He captures the feeling of  Dubliners towards the Easter Rising, before and after the executions, and  the attitude of those beyond the Pale (English-controlled region around  Dublin, where the phrase comes from) to the &quot;jackeens&quot;. Henry's  delay in leaving Ireland was, I believe, not as surprising as some seem to  think. Henry had great loyalty towards Michael Collins, similar to his  feelings towards James Connolly, a debt of honour, if you will, that kept  him from abandoning him while that was unresolved. After his betrayal and  the death of Collins, he was free to leave the country. These attributes  are visible in the character of Henry Smart, and are a major influence on  his actions. His various loyalties are strong and are probably the driving  force of his life.Before A Star Called Henry, I wasn't much a fan of  Roddy Doyle the author, preferring the film versions of the Barrytown  Trilogy, but I await with anticipation the remaining books in his latest  Trilogy.\",\n",

Before I purchased this book, I would of never thought about using Graph Vellum (Chapter 1, Design Supplies) for designing and now that's all I use to create my own artwork.I give this book a &quot;5&quot; star rating and everyone that purchases this book will learn something new.

Overall, she enjoyed the game and made her way through the scenes with just a little help. The programmers could have made the interface a bit better, though. The &quot;hot zones&quot; (where the pointer changes to allow for an action) are a bit small for some items so it gets difficult to position the mouse over an object to pick it up. Sometimes the pointer doesn't change at all. The system requirements are a bit high and we got just a &quot;good&quot; performance on my child's 300Mhz PII with a 32x SCSI CD-ROM. There are a number of bugs that we found as well. Mickey starts slanting at a 45-degree angle at the pond if you have him repeat a few actions. Music cuts out intermittently at a few scenes. There's also a problem with some earlier revisions of this game and it won't load if your system date goes past 12/31/2000 (a fix was posted to the [...] website recently). Overall, this was a decent try but I'd hope that Disney Interactive does a better job next time. I saw the earlier reviews and they seemed split 50-50 between &quot;fantastico&quot; and &quot;thppth&quot;. If you think you're PC-savvy enough to deal with these bugs and if your system has the horsepower, this program won't be excessively problematic.\",\n",

This one does look attractive. I don't like that I have to pull it out from under the counter top to fill it with water. So far I like the carafe, it seems to pour without spilling. Pouring the water into the receptacle in the back is tricky with the last bit of water, it tends to get into the grounds part and leak down onto the heating element. Its most annoying feature: you can't turn the warming plate back on to keep coffee warm.  There is no way to keep the coffee warm without running a new cycle of coffee. And the clock can't be set going backwards so you have to push the button down over and over for each minute, and if its 12 hours off, it takes forever to set it. Annoying. The time delay brew feature is nice. The permanent filter has been easy to clean. It is a pretty noisy machine when it brews but I don't mind that at all. Its part of the coffee experience. I do like the blue display light and the stainless steel look. The coffee it brews is ok. I made it pushing the strong brew button tonight and didn't see a difference. Its an ok machine. If you have low expectations about bells and whistles you will like this one.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Of all the headphones I have tried these produce these produce the best sound/noise canceling combo although I am not a sound aficionado. They are amazing on a plane with the exception of voices. Stewardesses, pilots and other passengers can be heard easily. I suppose it could be a good thing but I seem to prefer my old cheap Sonys to these as they cut out all exterior sound. Music and movies don't sound nearly as good but keep out 90%of all sound.They don't work unless the noise canceling is on (they have to be powered up to listen to them).  I find that while at home I would like to listen without noise canceling so I can listen for the phone, the doorbell etc. In a quiet environment I am not sure why they need to be on either. In any regard, it would be a pain to run out of juice on a plane trip as it may be difficult or impossible to recharge the battery and one would no longer be able to use their headphones. This is doubly bad since the batteries are proprietary. One would have to buy an extra set from Bose to guard against this possibility.The batteries seem to last a very long time (not sure how long but I left them on for at least 18 hours and they lasted another 1 or 2 with power remaining before charging). While these headphones are probably too nice to take backpacking or climbing it is not even an option for me as the battery could not be recharged. My preference would be to use AAA batteries. In my mind, it would be preferable as I would not have to worry about loosing a proprietary battery or charger and in the case of a long trip would not have to worry about the batteries running out.I have had several Bose products and I find that Bose does not play well with others. They often have proprietary connections etc. so that a consumer is locked in to Bose (I have also never had a lot of luck with their customer support although in their defense I always wanted their systems to work with other systems and they had little interest in that - they may be great with returns and service). These headphones appear to be the same. The cord to the headphones unplug from the headphones but the jack in the headphones seems to be an odd size. We have many headphones for our family and all the other cords are interchangeable. Not the QC3s. Probably not an issue but it may be that to replace the cord one would have to buy from Bose. In our house that may become an issue.The case that comes with the headphones simply stinks. The quality of the case seems fine but the headphones don't sit easily in the slots provided. If not placed precisely , the padding gets smashed and is uncomfortable for an hour or so (the padding comes back to form eventually).  I found an old case for another set of headphones that I use for travel and keep then in a drawer without a case at home. Small gripe but it seems bizarre to provide a case this well made for headphones this expensive that works poorly. Its like they had a bunch of cases for other headphones laying around. Rather than design a case for these headphones they simply used the old ones or share a case with other headphones they sell.These headphones were a gift. Before owning them I would have never considered buying them as my experiences with Bose have generally been bad (never the quality of the product, just that Bose will do everything they can to make sure you can only use their products when expanding a system etc.). Considering the other noise canceling headphones I have tried I would probably buy them anyway. They are comfortable, produce excellent sound and the best on the ear noise canceling I have found. My gripes are minor compared to that. If I found comparable quality in another set of headphones I would recommend them over the Bose QC3s. Given the choices I have seen I would recommend considering them if the gripes listed above are not big problems for you.\",\n",

But I spent a great deal of time with it last night, and this is the first book I have seen that is going to (finally) help me get my site finished. Simply put, the choice of sites used as examples in the book (and the collection is colorful and impressive) pull me in and make me WANT to create a site that looks and works like they do. One clue for me was that many of the sites chosen for examples are already among my favorite sites (Presto Studios being a conspicuous example).In my opinion web design books have suffered from one of two extremes: either they are so conceptual that there is no path leading to success for the novice site designer like my self; or they dwell so much on the technical, HTML-oriented side of web design and neglect the concept, storyboarding and other processes that lead to great content and presentation. This book balances both sides of the equation. Instead of miles of text instruction, this book simply says: &quot;this looks great, these are the things the site authors were going for, and here is how it is accomplished.&quot; The approach is very hands-on, yet more conceptual than technical (for coding there is no shortage of HTML manuals on the market). This book speaks to the artist in me, and inspires me to find the tools to use to bring my ideas to light, rather than the alternative equipping me with tools but without content direction.Above all, this book simply LOOKS great.

In the first text Twilight of the Idols, he offers a compelling attack on the prevalent beliefs of his time, including such thinkers as Hegel and Kant, as well as Socrates, theology, morality, and all things German. In the second text, the Anti-Christ, Nietzsche brilliantly and energetically provides his counter-arguement to Christianity and the ways the institution has distorted and murdered the teachings of Christ. His writing is breathtaking and his arguments are made in brief, explosive flashes of immense genius. However, his work can be exhausting as he continues to negate all thought besides his own, and his ability to draw references can be formidable. I'm sure the latter essay will not be palatable to devout Christians but it is necessary that you read it, for it will surely shake the foundations of your belief.\",\n",

I felt everything that Marnie felt. I could see the story happening in front of me. I felt like I knew the characters.The story is told two different time periods. We see Marnie and Joe fall in love and we see how her life is now. This is a realistic story.Marnie had flaws, she was no where near perfect. She was real. I loved that about her. I was able to connect with her, but at the same time my heart ached for her.A Little Bit of Everything Lost is amazing. I couldn&#8217;t read and turn the pages quick enough. Stephanie Elliot did an incredible job at weaving between the past and present, in the beginning I wasn&#8217;t sure it would work, but it did. Thinking back on it now, I can&#8217;t imagine another way for it to have been written. The chapters switch back and forth showing us teenage Marnie&#8217;s life and her adult life, the way it was written, gave more depth to her character and let us know her on another level. I felt like we were best friends, like I had known her my entire life. I don&#8217;t think I have ever felt that way about a character before.This novel is thought provoking. It will make you reflect on your own life and decisions that you have made. You will be wondering what would have happened if you would have done this or that differently. Where would you be today? That&#8217;s one of the questions I was asking myself when I finished reading this novel.This is the first book by this author that I have read, and it won&#8217;t be the last. I loved A Little Bit of Everything Lost and I recommend it to everyone who is looking for a story where the characters are relatable, the story line is realistic, and will make you think about your own life.',\n",

As a result of following the program my back pain is relieved.  I no longer have weeks that I have to walk crooked with back spasms.  The program relaxs, strengthens, and stretches.  I have flexibility I never did before.Mimi is a great instructor.  I would recommend this tape to anyone with back problems.  For the cost of one co-payment at physical therapy, I can now just put on the DVD and get results I never got at physical therapy.  I no longer have to take the pain meds.  I hope this doesn't sound like an informercial.  I got the DVD and it worked.  I feel better.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I won't summarize the plot too much (very well done elsewhere) but I do want to add my own 2 cents/review.This is not my normal reading material (I've been saying that a lot since getting my Kindle).  I had downloaded the first book in the series (Venus in Blue Jeans) as a freebie a long time ago and never got around to it as it's not my normal fare.  However, I spotted this one on another website and realized that it's part of a series, and every title sounded like fun reading--and oh joy,  I already had the first one!  I was in the mood for fun and different (for me) so I wiped the electronic dust off the first book and dove in and enjoyed it so much I immediately downloaded the rest.The first four Konigsburg books focused on four brothers who made their way to Texas from Iowa.  This one is number 5 and the main female character is the cousin of the female lead from Venus in Blue Jeans.  With all the intertwined characters I really like how the author pulls in the previous characters in a normal fashion.  A lot of times when reading a series like this the previous characters get minor and/or contrived cameos.  Here the old characters play big enough roles so you can get a real sense of what is going on with them (and that their Happily Ever Afters remain in place) but their presence makes sense within the context of the story.Another thing I noticed, and liked, is that the details surrounding the main story really keep the book a cut above the mundane.  Smaller town living, smaller town politics, Texas, vineyards, veterinarians as well as tons of fascinating minor characters really fill out the books.  The details really make the difference between run of the mill reading and something like this, which is just better.In any case, for a lighter read with a lot of fun and amusing characters this book fits the bill.  If  you haven't read the previous titles yet I would recommend going in order--things make just a little more sense in terms of the recurring characters (except one that that may have had a gender change somewhere in the writing...I need to go back and figure that one out...).  Oh, and for a 'hotness rating'  I suspect it is a little mild when compared to some of the other Samhaim published works... I would call this a strong R.  Details enough to know exactly what was going on, but not enough to overwhelm the story and the language was not too explicit.To sum up, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

       "  'reviewText': 'In 2008 Bear Family released 3 sampler CDs in 5\" card sleeves - \"Snatch & Grab It\", \"Country Boy\\'s Dream\" and \"Juke Joint Boogie\". These initial singular card issues were retailing (in the UK) at 2 and as Bear Family product is the best and NEVER sold cheap, not surprisingly these cute little tasters with their huge number of tracks and great sound got snapped up for the bargains they were. They were then reissued in jewel cases with proper booklets at full price once that initial offer expired (over 12).\"All We Wanna Do Is ROCK\" is another sampler in that vein - this time concentrating on Bear Family\\'s highly successful and much-praised \"Rocks\" series and it\\'s complimentary \"Rockin\\' Rollin\\'\" issues (over 40 CDs since 2002 and counting).Issued in the UK and Europe in June 2010, Bear Family BCD 17038 has 36 tracks, a gatefold card sleeve (no booklet) and clocks in at a mighty 80:27 minutes. It retails at 4 to 5 in Europe depending on where you buy it, so it will be a reasonably priced import in the USA.It is of course a mixture of the good, the great and the crappy. Not even the most liberal-minded Rock \\'n\\' Roll fan is going to say that Pat Boone \"rocks\" - more like \"sucks\". And the teen pap that is Connie Francis\\' \"Lipstick On Your Collar\" - yuck!Both Cochran and Vincent are naturally included (their \"Rocks\" sets come out in July 2010) as are more Rhythm \\'n\\' Blues based acts like The Cadillacs, The Treniers and Lloyd Price. Rock \\'n\\' Roll is here too in the shape of Wanda Jackson (\"Let\\'s Have A Party\" lyrics above), Bill Haley and Jack Scott. There\\'s some Country with Charlie Rich (fabulous voice) and Conway Twitty. One of my favourites is the brill Screamin\\' Jay Hawkins track \"Little Demons\" which makes me laugh every time and also the fantastic 1956 remake of his 1948 break-through hit \"Chicken Shack Boogie\" by Amos Milburn - an absolute rockin\\' gem that\\'s liable to make the dead literally get up and dance.Niggles - on the strength of this sampler, I was reminded that I had precious little music on two Rhythm \\'n\\' Blues giants - Amos Milburn and Smiley Lewis. So I bought both. They arrived and I was suitably knocked out. Each of the \"Rocks\" issues has a 3-way card digipak with a 40 to 50+ page booklet featuring beautifully rendered 78\\'s and 45\"s, concert posters, themed CD labels, clear tray with a suitable 7\" single pictured beneath, a biography on the artist peppered with pictures and even a detailed discography pertaining to every track at the end of the booklet. They are properly beautiful and of course given Bear Family\\'s legendary excellence at remasters - they sound fab too. My point is that the gatefold card sleeve of this sampler gives no real indication of this - and it should. It would have been far better if this set had reflected the way the series actually looks. A 3-way digipak with a proper booklet, maybe sell it at 6 and act as a loss leader. As it stands, it feels like a magazine or a Sunday newspaper freebie - and that does \"All I Wanna Do Is ROCK\" a huge disservice. Genuinely - when you actually have one of the \"Rocks\" CDs in your hands, it\\'s a thing of beauty.Still, I did buy two compilations because of it, so I suppose it worked...All in all, I urge you to check out this sampler - it\\'s shockingly enjoyable. But as a music lover, be prepared to punish that credit card, because after the Amos Milburn and Smiley Lewis purchases, I\\'m now thinking I need at least 10 more of the titles listed below...In the vernacular, recommended Daddy O!PS: The \"Rocks\" Series by Bear Family features the following artists:1.

In Eire, the past is passion and even the newest landmark looks like the oldest place you ever saw.And Roddy Doyle captures the melodic  cacophony of Irish history, passion and appetite in his new novel, &quot;A  Star Called Henry.&quot; It is narrated by Henry Smart, who takes us  through his first 20 years, from his birth into Dublin's savage poverty in  1901 through the romance of his naive young mother and one-legged alcoholic  father.The real ghosts of Ireland's rebellion drift in the background  of this novel, providing harmony to Henry's fictional life. The heady  passions of Dublin and the quirks of its people are spun into the yarn so  deftly the reader will actually hear a brogue in Doyle's dialogue. It's  funny and moving at the same time, an Irish peculiarity. But it is also an  immense story about a small island where ghosts walk among the living, just  as Henry Smart walks among us, real as a Dublin fog.\",\n",

I\\'m too old to bother with that now.  So I tried curling brushes, irons, blow dryers, etc.  I was unable to work any of them properly....it seemed to me that I needed 3 hands to do it right.  So I thought I\\'d try hot rollers.WOW! DOUBLE WOW!!!This took no time at all, and I look great...like I just came from the salon.  I wasn\\'t even sure I was doing it right.  Maybe I wasn\\'t, but my hair came out with just the right amount of curl, smooth and shiny.......AND NO FRIZZ.

I should have bought the \"all large\" or \"all jumbo\" roller sets.  But that\\'s a personal decision.I\\'m 68 years old and can style my own hair for the first time in my life.  I\\'m loving this.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Like another reviewer, I have had a set of Conair hot rollers that lasted me for 10+ years.  So easy to use and gave me beautiful hair.  However, the flocking had worn off, so I was always burning my fingers, plus I had lost most of the pins.  I found this set as a replacement, expecting to receive generally the same set.  I wanted multiple roller sizes, but it seems like the diameter of these rollers are smaller than my old set.  Guess I needed a jumbo size to compare to what I had before.  I have long, thick heavy hair (length is at my bra line), so I have to use all of them at once to hold all my hair.  The rollers themselves are wonderful.  Great curl!  But the clips are horrible!!  They leave bad dents in my hair and just barely hold the rollers in if I'm lucky.  I'll be looking for some metal pins to hold these in, but otherwise great set giving me lots and lots of curls that lasted two days.\",\n",

Askins from what I've been told (via my husband reading passages to me), was a hard man raised by a hard man.  He was more than likely to hold a grudge and yet seems to be able, in time, to admit that.  While not agreeing with everything Askins says and does, my husband still acknowledges his skills and in some very weird way likes him.

The intrepid reader will learn there was much more to the nazi terror regime than the trench coated thugs we see depicted in the movies and the author gives an excellent account of the internal intrigue that existed inside the reich's highest levels and most sinister offices. This book is a tough read, more suited to academia than storytelling ( not that the term applies well to chronicling of nazi horrors).

I refuse to give spoilers so you can experience the full effect of the story so I won't go into details of why I felt these things; but, you can rest assured I did feel it.  Second, the story itself was just different and well done. Lastly, most stories today seem to drag out or leave something open at the end so they can write sequels.  I found though that this story not only came to a solid conclusion, it was a satisfying one as well. Kudos to Keary Taylor for not trying to leave an opening just to get more money.

       "  'reviewText': 'Although this is a horror novel, I must admit that I was more enticed by the romance in this one! LOL Part of the reason is that, with the title, and subtitle, The Pram: A Baby Seeking Revenge, as I did, readers will more than likely guess what will be happening,.. It is so well written, however, that I even caught a hint of humor under it all...Or maybe I was enjoying the spoiled daughter and the attentive mother who was running herself ragged taking care of her daughter... Why do parents these days do that?!!! It sure didn\\'t happen in my generation, nor in the author\\'s, I\\'m guessing...Carrie had seen the pram at a second-hand store and immediately recognized the quality, knowing that the rich and famous, including Prince Charles, would have used this type of carriage... After a little bit of negotiating, Carrie bought it for her daughter\\'s baby, who had not yet been born...Of course, her daughter immediately realized that it was old and second-hand--not anything like the new ones available, so Carrie offered to take it back. But it stayed long enough for her daughter to begin to like it...Which was fortunate, because she soon went into labor!But when Carrie had looked into the Pram one day, she saw a baby! Or was she crazy. Thinking it over, naturally, Carrie assumed that if indeed she had seen a ghost, then it was attached to the pram itself. So she went back to the shop to see if she could find anything out about the owner and return the pram! The shop was gone--empty of any business and clearly that way for a long time.The Pram soon went into the nearby river, with the hope that the ghost would stay with the buggy...It didn\\'t... And then the baby started watching Carrie, as if wanting to be picked up. Carrie was the only one who knew anything about what she\\'d seen. How could she share it with anybody and not have them think she was crazy. Perhaps she was? How could she explain what she\\'d seem, especially since the shop was no longer there where she had bought the Pram...Could it get any worse? Oh yes, it could... Because it was quite clear that the ghost baby was there for Carrie! And then it spoke to her, wanting to know why Carrie had murdered her...Readers soon begin to pick up what was going on as Carrie tries to deal with the situation without talking to anybody else. She even took a trip back home, but found that only caused a different type of pain when she discovered her father was going into dementia and thought Carrie was once again 16--when it happened.She did, however, on that trip chance to meet the young man she had once been in love with... Even though they had once been good friends, she could not tell him what was happening to her...A simple love story that has been told over and over across the world of young love, torn apart when parents begin to make decisions for that couple. The story created by Betty Woodcock is not only horrible to consider because of the controversial issue that continues in today\\'s world, it puts the spotlight on those children who never make it into the world. Do they wish for revenge? Quite scary to contemplate, isn\\'t it?And if that were to occur...well, just try to get rid of it this time...Carrie certainly couldn\\'t!Woodcock not only gives us a scary tale based upon real life actions, but provides a well-written story line that allows us to consider the \"what ifs\" while we tell ourselves, over and over, it\\'s just fiction, it\\'s just fiction...it\\'s just...Horror galore in a simple small package... You decide because it may not be to your taste...Me, I thoroughly enjoyed it!GABixlerReviews',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This is just one more of those glossy New  Age Jesus conspiracy books that titillate the curiosity but, in the end, leave you feeling empty because they\\'re founded upon bogus research and the whims of the author. I consider the production of these books a racket. It is a falsehood that generates alot of money.  Legitimate, unbiased scholarship is not as lucrative.The authors of these books play this game called \"wouldn\\'t it be neat if...?\"  For example, wouldn\\'t it be neat if Jesus was a Pythagorean Gnostic Kabbalist who was trained in Egypt or India?  Wouldn\\'t it be neat if Jesus and Mary Magdalene were secretly married and hid out in France so we could uncover this big Vatican conspiracy like in The DaVinci Code?I can\\'t figure out if the authors of these books are gullible enough to believe their sources or if they deliberatey pull a con job to sell more books to a following that wants to believe this stuff.The only thing I can credit this author for is denying the Priory of Sion hoax perpetrated by Pierre Plantard which became the basis for Holy Blood Holy Grail and The DaVinci Code. However, he perpetrated alot of other myths.  Some of hs sources included the following:  Robert Eisenman, who believes Jesus was a god-man created by pro-Roman gentiles to undermine the Jewish resistance movement (forget about all the gentile Christians who were martyred by Romans);  the so called Akashic Record which conjures up Jesus in past lives  ie Edgar Cayce;  Ahmad Osman who suggested that Jesus could have been King Tut - OH PLEASE!!!;  Nicholas Notovitch who discovered that Jesus was in India and was considered an incarnation of Buddha (Buddhist monks later had a good laugh when they admitted to some tourists that they pulled a fast one on some westerners);  The Gospel of the Holy Twelve supposedly discovered by a clergyman who later admitted that it was given to him by revelation.  In other words, he made the whole thing up.The author was convinced that Jesus didn\\'t die on the cross and he used the 8th century Quran and 9th century anti-Christian Muslim literature to try to prove his point.  Forget about the New Testament and second and third century testimonies of martyrs who staked their lives on their belief that Jesus died and was raised again.  This is an example of putting the cart in front of the horse.The author made sweeping assumptions without considering historical facts.  The author was convinced that Jesus was a gnostic and that the Nag Hammadi writings are more credible than the New Testament.  Most credible scholars would agree that the New Testament is much older than these writings and that the gnostic gospels were parasitic in regard to the canonical gospels.  This is another example of putting the cart in front of the horse.The author claimed that very few scholars believe that Peter was ever in Rome.  Clement of Rome, who composed one of the oldest writings outside the New Testament dated at the end of the first century, wrote that both Peter and Paul were martyred in Rome.  I\\'ll take his word over these so-called \"scholars\".The author included the \"Nestorians\" among those groups who don\\'t believe in the divinity of Christ.  The term \"Nestorian\" was given to the Holy Apostolic and Catholic Church of the East.  I have observed their liturgy and they revere the Apostle Paul and read his epistles as well as recite the Nicean Creed.  Saint Pachomius and the Coptic Egyptian desert hermits, who the author lauded in this book, were ultra-orthodox Christians and would be appalled at some of the claims made in this book.The author parroted the same tired old Paul and \"Paulinism\" versus the original Nazarene community in Jerusalem theme.  The Nazarene Christians accepted the apostleship of Paul and supported his mission to the gentiles.  I highly recommend Nazarene Jewish Christianity by Ray Pritz who did an in depth study of the Nazarenes based on the oldest and most reliable sources.  The so-called Ebionites who disparaged Paul didn\\'t arise until the second century and were most likely the heirs of the Hellenist faction who Paul persecuted and were driven out of Jerusalem prior to Paul\\'s conversion (see Marcel Simon\\'s St. Stephen and the Hellenists in the Early Church).If Jesus survived the cross and hid out in France leaving his followers to suffer the most horrific persecutions for proclaiming him to be the risen Lord and Saviour, he would have been the greatest con-man and humbug who ever lived.  His disciples and other apostles, including James and Paul, would have been among the most gullible and stupid men who ever lived.Do you really believe that?',\n",

Sound quality wise these are probably in the $50-$75 range.  Much better headphones can be had for cheaper.  My friend thought these were the best he'd ever heard until he tried my denons, now he has a pair of denons and gave the bose to his brother =P.Isolation: I didn't really find the noise cancellation to help too much.  It cut out some noise, but because the noise cancelling works by introducing additional noise it actually lowers the overall sound quality of the headphone.  If you're really concerned about isolation I would look into some hi end in ear monitors.  For this price range you could get a pair of shure se530s, sennheiser ie8s, westone 3s, or ultimate ear triplefi 10 pro, all of which have better sound quality.These headphones are decent at best and if you take the time to do a little more research on other brands you'll find a whole other world of better headphones.  If you thought Bose was the pinnacle of audio quality you clearly haven't heard any real hi end audio.\",\n",

They worked well for all mountain riding.  In Jackson Hole, I had a pretty spectacular couple of days, and with it one pretty spectacular huck.  The safety lanyard on the ski pole mount saved the camera after a lay down in knee deep pow.  The cost of the accessory package was worth this one save alone.  I am very happy with the Contour +2, and this is the gear that made all the cool videos possible.I do advise a little caution with the adhesive backed mounts.  I have \"backed up\" all of my helmet mounts with screws set through the mounts and into the helmet.  The screws cost twenty cents and the camera costs BIG Bucks.  Even if you don\\'t think you are going to be doing any crashing and burning, back up the adhesives with screws, and use the lanyards on all mounts.  When you are going steep and deep a miscalculation will put remarkable stresses on everything.  Last thing you want to do is yard sale your camera.If Contour included set screws with the mounts, I\\'d give them five stars.

Now, this is not a review of any of McCourt's work, which just happens to be a great mass of  'poor me' drivel. Nevertheless, I believe that after the last two years of  the McCourts putting forward one particularly scewed version of Irish  history, Doyle has now been lumped into the same category. This is  unfortunate because 'A Star Called Henry' is one of Doyle's most important  displays of writing to date. Every passage entrances and Doyle's gritty,  tough writing brings you into the story so that you are fighting beside  Henry, laughing beside him, and almost dying beside him as well. Doyle is a  very real writer, and although Henry may do some very surreal things in the  book, the fact remains that Doyle's honesty and knowledge of his own past  shine through brilliantly. Doyle's rendering of the Anglo-Irish war and the  subsequent Civil War are by far the best that any author of fiction has  penned to date. Frank McCourt Tisn't, Roddy Doyle Tis'.\",\n",

As a denominational leader in a mainline church (ELCA Lutheran), I\\'ve had a front-row seat to this often messy, painful process. There are many writers and scholars speaking to this phenomenon in books, blogs, and other media outlets - and I appreciate their insights. However, I\\'ve found none more personal, pointed, and profound than what Mike Breen has given us in \"Leading Kingdom Movements\". Out of Breen\\'s personal story, we get access into the larger story of God\\'s people invited - and challenged - to see Christian ministry in new ways. God is up to something BIG. Breen helps us understand how we might not just be a witness to this global move of God in the 21st century. We are invited to join others in LEADING this Kingdom movement! How amazing is that?! Read this book. You\\'ll thank me later.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': '\"NYPD Blue\" was probably the most realistic portrayal of the New York City Police Department since.....\"Barney Miller\" (and that\\'s not a joke!).  The subtleties of the Squad Room and on the streets are left that way...\"subtle\"....even within the show, leaving it up to the viewer to catch them (much like real life).The one drawback of Season 1 for me was, unfortunately, David Caruso\\'s \"Det. John Kelly\" overplaying his predictable part as the laid-back cop playing off the the more \"outgoing\" Andy Sipowitz (Dennis Franz).  Caruso only lasted the one season, more or less (I believe at his own request), and the part of Andy\\'s partner was then magnificently played by a true New Yorker, Jimmy Smits, who moved the part into an easily believable portrayal, including his own New York \"subtleties.\"Some (much?) credit should be given to Gordon Clapp for his performance as the somewhat less-than-self-confident \"Detective Greg Medavoy\" who, despite that, rises to the mandates of the police situations presented to him, to the point where Sipowitz in a later episode calls Medavoy a \"good cop,\" a true compliment coming from a seasoned officer.  Nice job Gordon.While certainly not a \"to be continued\" type of show, keep in mind that many of the episodes\\' story lines (but not all) are continued or referred to in the next episodes (much like real police work), and if you purchase a full season you\\'ll find yourself not watching only one episode, but the next one following. And the one after that.  It can get addictive...!As we look at what passes for \"entertainment\" on television today (\"Gator Boys,\" \"Jersey Shore,\" etc), having all the seasons of this great show readily available is really a God-send.  Thank you, Amazon!',\n",

Unfortunately, the product description didn't contain information regarding the sink cutout size. It turned out that the faucet didn't fit through the IKEA sink cutout (3.5 cm), cut with the IKEA provided tool. The faucet seems like a well made product, it even has hoses attached (separate buy with many other faucets).  So given the above caveat, I'd recommend the faucet based on quality and price. The finish is like metal, and only close inspection reveals that it's made from a high grade plastic.Edit: The seller waived the restocking fee when I called them to return the item.

If you like YA paranormal books, you are going to love this.Rhiannon Godfrey has been gifted or cursed (depends on what day it is and what her mood is) with a variety of paranormal talents. She sees ghosts, accidentally moves things in fits of temper, and is a bit precognitive. She's also a teenager with all the assorted body image, boy and popularity issues associated with it. She claims she just wants to be normal--like an average teen, but what does that mean and is ordinary really what she wants to be?Wiccan Cool deals with a variety of common issues (self esteem, sense of self, self-centeredness) within the framework of this mystery/slice-of-life-novel.I really grew to like Rhiannon as she struggles with her typical fifteen-year-old self-centeredness when she is called to volunteer in a hospital pediatric cancer ward. It's an eye opening experience for her.I'm buying a copy of this book for my daughter. Actually, since Wiccan Cool is the third in Traci Hall's Rhiannon Godfrey series (and the only one I've read thus far) I want to get the other two for her first. Wiccan Cool stands alone, but there are enough hints of the stories to pique my interest about the earlier books--Her Wiccan Wiccan Ways and Something Wiccan This Way Comes.[...]\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Welcome back to Konigsburg, Texas. Won't you stay awhile? Catch up with familiar faces, and meet some new ones. Deidre Brandenburg has taken up residence in this little town, hoping to start a new life for herself instead of being under her father's fairly controlling days. In her mid-twenties, it's about time Deidre follows her own heart and dreams, even at the cost of Big John's angriness.Thank goodness Tom Ames owns the empty building that Deidre wants to use to run her coffee business. Problem is, she's got no access to major funds. Working for Tom seems to be the logical thing to do, though she knows nothing about waitressing. Things are really going to get interesting around this town, that's for sure!Deidre strives for independence. The stubborn woman doesn't want anyone taking pity on her, nor does she want help. She needs to do this on her own, to be on her own. After years of being under Big John's thumb and living ever so cautiously, it's time for things to change. Oh, they change all right. She meets her match in Tom -- he is as stubborn as she and doesn't accept help easily either. Their growing attraction to one another gets mighty intense. Both want to help the other out and have to learn to allow it, or their building relationship won't work.Enter an ex-boyfriend sent by Deidre's father and here comes trouble. Craig is up to no good and has an ulterior motive of his own. I spent the rest of this book wondering whether he was going to come between Deidre and Tom.Brand New Me is an engaging contemporary read full of emotions and wonderful characters that you can't help but love. I applaud Deidre for her quest to finally branch out and make a life of her own, and she stuck with it well, considering the financial strain and the lack of support from her father. In Konigsburg, she found new friends that welcomed her. She transformed from a stuffy woman in a suit to a woman who is able to let loose and open her heart to new possibilities. She and Tom are a perfect match. Ms. Benjamin really knows how to create memorable characters and put them through plenty of drama.If you enjoy a fiercely independent heroine who finally chooses her own destiny, a hero who would do anything for her, a small town full of unforgettable people, then plan your visit to Konigsburg. When you leave, you'll be smiling.Originally posted at The Long and Short of It Romance Reviews\",\n",

The book is based on a study done by Jennifer Elam, a practicing clinical psychologist.  She did a participant observation study exploring the experiences of people who felt/knew that God was \"speaking to them\". The intersection here between a genuine experiential sense of hearing God\\'s call along one\\'s spiritual journey and what might be delusional/psychotic episodes is well described.  Dr. Elam notes that she is doing this study for \"personal reasons\", as she alludes tohaving experienced some personally dark emotional times. She also, however, sensitively shares and honors the experiences shared by her interviewees.I recommend this book for its careful exploration of the topic.  She raises important issues/questions for psychotherapists, who are seeking to listen carefully and respectfully to their clients\\' spiritual experiences.  Such listening is crucial to the therapist\\'s witnessing his/her clients\\' psychological and spiritual growth.',\n",

Some of the poems that I liked( or `loved\\', as you may) were:Some clocks tock upon the wall,Chance would be a fine thing,Untitled,Stand beside the one you love,Wanting,Cleaning windows,Long enough on the island,The poltergeist rap!,Side to side.Critically speaking the Poems and Songs written in the book are very well constructed, and it has some of the best verses I have ever read. The poem will make you smile but the message will (if not make your eyes moist) surely make you think (about lot of things; better not go in details :). But as they say with every good thing comes opposite... some of the poems were simply not for me. This maybe because of appreciation of art is very subjective factor and the ones I didn\\'t liked might end up being your favorite ones.And so on concluding notes, \"Chance would be a fine thing\" by Anthony McCann is a very nice (and very tiny) book, which says much more than words it has. Take the example of Untitled, shortest verse but full of meaning. Well I\\'ll give this book 4 of 5. Enjoy.',\n",

The book is some 20 years old but the grammatical information provided is still current and valid.This book is really not intended for people who just want to get a glimpse of the Ladakhi language but since this is one of the few books available, even a casual interest may warrant its purchase.We have found that the book is very difficult to obtain through Amazon or other traditional resources, presumably because of a minimal initial print run. You may need to try several different sources.The book contains chapters on all of the typical subjects (phonology, morphophonemics, noun phrases, verb phrases, etc.) as well as a sample verb paradigm and some sample texts (in transliteration). Used in conjunction with Getting Started In Ladakhi, you'll come away with a fairly rounded understanding of the structure and grammar of Ladakhi.A Roman transliteration scheme is used throughout the book which is its only real fault. Ideally, this book should be reprinted with the Tibetan script to enhance its usability.\",\n",

I\\'m sure the people on the flight next to me thought I was crazy!There are so many important truths, principles and stories for the Church to hear, process and respond to.I\\'ve had the privilege of seeing Mike & Sally Breen up close-- living this book before my eyes. Though my orbit around their lives and ministry is wider than many, I can say with such confidence that they truly live what they teach. This book, then, is simply and profoundly the story and wisdom of a couple who are currently leading a Kingdom movement.In the 100-year-old church I lead, we are seeing the information of this book and the model of imitation provided by Mike, Sally and the 3DM team, empower us to see the Kingdom come in our little town and beyond.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"The man behind `Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha' and `The Barrytown Trilogy', Roddy Doyle, is capable of working more magic than we readers can ever imagine, and `A Star Called Henry' is a testament to his ability as a historian and a storyteller. Never has a miserably poor Irish childhood like Henry Smart's been described in more beautiful prose, replete with imagery of dead siblings reborn as stars. Henry Smart's boyhood in the dirty, crime-infested streets of Dublin is humorous, touching and often sad. Orphaned not by the death of his parents but by poverty and abandonment, Henry leads his younger brother Victor into a life of crime; hunger and desperation being their main motivation for `fecking' bread and killing cows with blades hidden in caps. The hard life led by the children is tempered with the tenderness the brothers feel for each other. Henry and Victor's attempt at `getting an education' is seriously funny, but the gaiety does not last long. Victor dies of tuberculosis, and this bitter experience shapes many of Henry's beliefs and ideals as an adult. By the time he is 14, Henry is a handsome young hulk in the Irish Republican Army. In the Army, he finds love, respect, but also betrayal. At once a love story and a history of the Irish Rebellion, `A Star Called Henry' is a novel that is all substance and no filler.\",\n",

I started watching it recently and I have one word to describe it and that is amazing. This show is so well written and acted with a great blend of comedy, action and drama that works so well. I am a fan of Hill Street Blues as well so I see many similarities and familiar faces which makes the show even more enjoyable to watch. One of the great things about this show is that the cops are not necessarily the good ones, they can be scene violating people's rights and leading witnesses and criminals in their confessions to help them when they end up in court which is completely unethical, but the writers help us sympathize with these characters even if they are doing things that against the law or unethical. Dennis Franz is amazing in this show and nearly every time he is on screen, you don't know what to expect whether he is going to say something rude, racist or funny.\",\n",

I don\\'t think other brands are having such a nice display so far.To optimizing the usage of the Color LCD, Full album art has been added when playing music streaming.  It makes the music playing experience much happier.  The TwonkyMedia server that comes with it is much easier to be used comparing to Windows Media Player.  And you know what, I can play my iTunes music to my NP1100 and NP2900 both by using TwonkyMedia. I can see Philips is really improving the user experience in its Streamium products.One more benefit is that, without turning on my PC, I can still listen to Internet radio and Rhapsody and I will set up my favorite stations in Clubs Philips previously when using NP1100.  And now, in NP2900, I just join back the Clubs Philps with the same account, my favorite stations are all there.In summary, in additional to its alarm feature, I found it great to be used in my bedroom and making my dream to listen to soft music before sleep in a good sound quality becoming true.',\n",

It presents a great deal of information in a straightforward fashion. It never annoys you with gimmicks like icons, cute headings, or a book-for-dummies writing style. Even so, it is clearly written, not at all dry.Living Judaism has become a valued reference since I first read it completely a year ago.  As I learn more about Judaism from attending services and Torah study, I pick up Living Judaism almost every month for answers to specific questions. It has never failed me. The index is good too. I'm amazed at how good this book is and how much information it has in only 386 pages.I recommend this book above all others for an introduction to Judaism. I've read others. Some were far too big and encyclopedic (like Telushkin's Jewish Literacy). Others were so chockful of gimmicks that they were annoying to read.\",\n",

Author and psychiatrist Anthony J. Burlay, M.D. draws upon some of the core philosophy behind the Atkins diet to show the reader the importance of how and when to remove carbohydrates from the diet in order to nudge the body into burning its stores of fat for energy. At the same time, carbohydrates cannot be completely eliminated - vegetable carbs and plenty of fiber are particularly important to healthy nutrition and digestion, although The Foundation Diet does guide the reader toward eating meats and proteins much as the Atkins diet does. Above all, a critical key is not to simply skip meals or deprive oneself too much; such an action merely triggers the body to shift into fasting mode and conserve energy, rather than lose weight.

To answer this, I really cannot say for sure other than I never ran a full scan of my computer before. I normally ran quick scans which do not scan all files. A full scan checks everything and is what found all of the threats mentioned previously. Also there were times in between subscriptions where I was not protected by Norton so it could have happened in either instance. Take my advice....Conducting a full scan of your computer using Norton Antivirus products is the Key!!!!!  I highly recommend it!

That wouldn\\'t normally be difficult; however, the holes don\\'t line up, so when you insert the bolt, it doesn\\'t go through.  Additionally, the \"male\" end of the pole is less wide so it (theoretically) will slip into the \"female\" end of the other pole ... however, the \"female\" end is not wide enough for it to fit, so I had to reverse things and jerry rig. Also, where the holes are cut out in the pole to allow the bolts to slip through, they were not all the way finished ... i.e., the \"donut hole\" was still attached so when I tried to slip in the receiving part of that pole, it was obstructed. Had to break out the screw driver and hammer to hammer those donut holes off. Then, if I assembled it as instructed, I was to put a washer, then bolt, then washer, then nut; however, the bolt wasn\\'t long enough if you use the washers. All in all, I had to toss the short pole, stick the second pole into the ground (but it has a narrow base -- so it wiggles more than it should) and flip the third pole around (so now the narrow end it actually on top so the eye bolt holding the tetherball doesn\\'t quite fit right). Since I had already had everything unwrapped, spread out, unboxed, etc., and the shipping box is so heavy/long/difficult to handle, I opted for the jerry rig method as opposed to boxing it all back up and taking it down to be shipped and returned.

       "  'reviewText': \"This is what I've just sent to Coleman customer service:I recently used my son's new Perfect Flow Two-Burner Propane stove. I wanted to try it before buying one of my own. He warned me that it is impossible to adjust the flame and that it remains on high even after turning the knob to low.He was correct.When the adjustment knob is turned to the left to lower the flame it very briefly does just that, but as soon as you let go of the knob it quickly turns back to the right on its own and raises the flame -- as if its spring-loaded and the spring re-coils.This is fine for boiling water.It does not work for frying eggs, etc.Because I had a toolbox in the car, I was able to maintain a lower flame with an extreme jerry-rig using vice grips attached to the fuel-flow knob and a heavy adjustible wrench to rest against the vice grips to keep them from moving, thus keeping the knob from turning back to the right and increasing the flame.I find that to be excessive effort.I have read various reviews online, including here, and it seems others have found the same problem. Then again, many others give it positive reviews.I want to buy a camp stove and I otherwise like the Coleman. But I do not care to go through that effort every time.My questions: Are you aware of these problems? Have you done anything about it?Can I purchase a model that I can be sure allows for heat adjustment from simmer to full flame?\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"The Historical Novel is in many ways a dangerous territory. No description of historic events/times/places are written without the advantage of hindsight and, therefore, without opinions of what went down. This is true for both scholarly works (which this is not, of course) and fiction. When you mix fiction with facts and real people, you also run the risk of falsifying history to your readers: for someone unfamiliar with the time it is difficult to say what is fact and what is fiction.There are few uprisings covered in so many myths as the Irish in the beginning of the last century. The winner writes the history books and some facts become forgotten. Was Michael Collins a good guy or just a ruthless hood? Was De Valera a cynic or the great father of a nation? Doyle adds to the myth by relating the Easter Rising and the following years through the eyes of young Henry, a boy born and raised in Dublin's slum who goes on to become a killer for the Irish Cause-and for himself. He kills and he trains other to kill. All in all, not a very sympathetic guy. But Doyle lets him tell his story unbiased.Since I cannot see through Doyle's motives, I have to keep my distance when reading this book: I cannot allow myself to be &quot;sucked in&quot; in the otherwise very skillfully drawn environment. This is not pure fiction: I am certain Doyle wants to make a point, but I cannot fathom what it is. Surely he wants to say something else than &quot;people were very poor in Ireland and then there was a civil war&quot;. These nagging doubts kept me from enjoying the book, and that is not how it should be. Hence the &quot;only&quot; medium rating.I think the Barrytown trilogy (The Commitments, The Snapper, The Van) was better since I did not have to worry so much about the motives when reading them. Sure, they are commenting and reflecting on the modern Irish society but the author's point of view is easy to grasp and, indeed, to sympathise with.Review written on St Patrick's Day, 2001\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I want to praise the video \"Back In Shape\" DVD.  I hurt my back last May and nothing was making it better.  Lots of drugs, but the pain wouldn\\'t go away.  I was ready to try anything to make the pain stop.  I watched a show on National Public Television featuring Dr. Veejay Vad.  He is a back pain specialist and had a DVD offered for a gift to the station.  I ordered that, but while I was waiting for it to arrive (I really was in a lot of pain) I got the idea to do some looking around.  I found this video on Amazon.com.  I sure am glad I did.I ordered the DVD and have been using it almost every day since.  At first there were some exercises that I couldn\\'t do without pain, so I skipped those.  Now I find myself being able to do all of the exercises pain free.  Well at least all the exercises that I can do, there are a couple that I am just not flexible enough to do in the suggested way.  That is not related to my back injury.  I am not a very flexable person.Again, this is a great video.  I really like it.  It is easy to follow and works for me on an emotional level as well as the physical one. I attrribute my current pain free (or nearly) condition primarily to usind this DVD.UPDATE;  11/5/11, I have been using this video for a few months now.  I can\\'t say enough about it.  It has not only cleared up my back pain, but also discomfort that I had been experinecing in my hips and neck.  My neck, and back are more flexable, and stronger, now than they have been for years.\\\\UPDATE 10/16/12, I am still using this video at least 5 times a week.  I haven\\'t had more than a twinge of back pain in so long I can\\'t remember the last time.  And when I do have a twinge, its just that, a twinge and goes away.  I have also experienced many other benifits from using this video.  My neck and shoulders had been getting increasingly stiff.  I would notice it at times like looking behind me to backup the car.  No more.  I am stronger, more limber, and less uncomfortable than I have been for over 20 years.This video has enriched my life.  It has freed me from constant pain.  I can\\'t say enough about it.',\n",

They were very good, but I had expected outstanding. What left me impressed was that my ears were only slightly red after 8 straight hours of music. One hour later, I put the QC3 on again for the next leg of my journey.Noise-cancelling: When I tried on the QC3 for the very first time, the first thing I thought was that it doesn't seem to cancel out high frequencies as well as the low ones. Putting them on for the very first time, with and without music playing, I was left thinking that only half of the noise was gone. In the Parisian subway system there are plenty of screetching sounds that still put the same chill up my spine as before. The good thing is that if the QC3 is well-fitted on my ears, it will cancel out most constant background noise so I can lose myself in my music.Audio quality: I detected only a small difference in quality between the QC3 and my $20 Sennheiser HD 202 headphones listening to Aaron Copland's Appalachian Spring concert suite directed by Leonard Bernstein in MP3 format at 192kb/s. I didn't appreciate the lower frequencies in the QC3, which had lost some of their quality. Some of the low frequencies seemed to be missing. Overall though, the QC3 seemed truer to what it might sound like in concert.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I decided to buy this edition instead of the newest one based on a blog post on Whipstitch Fabrics that said the newest edition cut out a lot of content.  After reading through a couple random sections of the book, I can see why some content may have been removed.  For example, in the chapter on tailoring, there's a section that walks you through how to handsew interfacing onto the undercollar.  For most home sewers these days, that is probably not the most relevant advice, since now we have fusible interfacing.  Of course, I can well imagine that the best results are still obtained with handsewing, and many serious sewers would get a lot out of those instructions, but the majority of hobbyists would probably not want to put that much effort into a collar.  At any rate, this book definitely bears the hallmark of a different era.  Whether that is good or bad completely depends on the needs of the reader.  If you are a casual hobbyist that just wants to make some fun projects every now and then, I imagine you would be better served by the newer edition that would cover all the new time-saving shortcuts that have been developed since the 70s.  But if you are a serious enthusiast or professional trying to learn all the different techniques to perfect your craft, then this book provides some really great insights that probably wouldn't be found in modern home sewing references.In terms of instructional quality, I am very impressed with this book.  All of the techniques are demonstrated in line-drawings next to the text, and very clearly convey the manipulations being done.  If you prefer photographs, the newer edition may be more helpful to you; but for myself, the line-drawings are more than adequate.  One aspect of teaching that this book does not cover is the theory.  It covers plenty of how-to's, but very few why's.  This could be frustrating to someone seeking a more in-depth education on sewing, but makes it a very good streamlined manual.The book is laid out very much like an encyclopedia, with techniques grouped by subject (e.g. seams, necklines, waistlines).  This makes it not very conducive to just sitting down and reading through it, as it's a bit dry and does not offer any coherent workflow; but it makes it easy to look something up.  It gives you all the different parts that are involved in making a garment, but does not really put it all together to teach you the process.  I feel that this makes it a great reference and teaching tool, but a total beginner is not going to pick up this book and learn how to sew.  If you are a beginning sewer, I would recommend you get a projects-based book to go along with this book, to give you a framework in which to apply the methods taught in this book.  But because this book contains so much technical information laid out in an easy to find way, it will never lose its value as a warhorse, and will grow with the reader.All in all, this book is a great tool for sewers, even though this edition isn't going to cover all the most up-to-date technologies.  But like all tools, its usefulness depends on the situation.  It's a great source for sewing techniques and the majority of information provided here is still highly relevant, despite the age of this edition; but it does not provide everything that anyone could possibly need.  New sewers will want to supplement this book with another that provides more overall direction, instead of just self-contained how-to's, and sewers seeking a complete understanding of the craft will want to look for something that delves deeper into the rationale behind these techniques.  It's probably also not a bad idea to supplement this book with a more modern reference that will cover the technological innovations since the 70s.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"This set is the first one I have seen to feature figures from the famed &#34;Death of Superman&#34; series that was so popular in the 90s. As a collector of things from that specific story line I felt I needed to grab this set which features characters from that comic.I have to say the figures are not what I was hoping for. Doomsday especially. He has bones coming out the side of his boots instead of his knees and is nothing like the Doomsday from the &#34;Hunter/Prey&#34; toy set put out by &#34;Kenner&#34; which is in my opinion the best looking toy Doomsday you can get.I was hoping in size these would be a bit closer to the 1989 &#34;Toy Biz&#34; figures but they are shrimps in comparison. My biggest gripe is the Doomsday character which has the stature of an ape, short stubby legs and a huge upper body. Bone that should come from his elbows comes from his hand extending to his elbows and it's all wrong.  Superman looks neat a little beat up but they could have torn his cap some too, his cap appears to be untouched. All in all if you are looking for display they are not terrible and certainly no little kid is going to complain. However if you are like me and are looking for absolute comic book replicas look into the &#34;Kenner&#34; Death of Superman line. Much cooler figures.\",\n",

Perhaps the explanation of \"Slow\" should be nearer the beginning of the book.Essentially this is a science fiction book about time travel but not in the sense that it is portrayed in many science fiction books \"Slowers\" can see the past and some interact with it however one person seems to be able to manipulate time. Set against this background two rival factions set about finding him and using him for their own ends. Not all time manipulations have the desired effect and there is an embedded warning not to tamper with time.There is a sub romantic plot and the background to the characters are nicely developed, it also deals with the relationship between a father and his daughter which is at times a wee bit tetchy.In all a book that has some good new ideas and worth reading if you like science fiction.',\n",

Just received and used right away in excitement, and according to past reviews by other users, I thought my long blonde, color treated hair would be so soft and smooth after using it...WRONG!  I could NOT get a comb through my long locks after using this product just once for the first time.  I have never had a problem getting a comb through my long, color treated hair, which is always on the slightly dry side, but I have always used &#34;PROFESSIONAL&#34; salon products, so what a mistake I made buying this stuff.  I should have known not to buy something that is primarily given complimentary at hotels...shame on me.  Crappy hotel shampoo and conditioner is not professional, and I should have known better.  The only good thing about this is that it has a pleasing fragrance.  Other than that, it is way toooooooooooooo expensive a price for this non-professional, drying hair product.  If you want to invest in a non-professional shampoo, just go to your local grocery/drug store and buy the same size (8.5 oz) hair shampoo in another well-known brand for half the price of this, as you'll get the same effect!\",\n",

Her other album 'Walking in the Air' has some of the same songs but they sound a little different. I'm not sure if they're new recordings or just mastered differently.  This Album 'Chloe' sounds like certain instruments are too close and the orchestra and the other stuff you really want to hear sound too far away.  The singing is bright as it should be.  Some of this could probably be fixed if you mess with the equalizer though.I didn't like all the arrangements of the songs right away but the more I listen to them the more I like them.  There were several songs I have never heard before like 'Angel's Song', When You Believe, and The Voice of Home.  Those songs seem a little silly but they have grown on me and I really like them now.I do think this album is worth the price they're asking even though several of the songs are on the other album and that it is also actually an older album.\",\n",

I usually wear a small and I sized up to a medium. If I wanted it to be looser fitting, I would have gone to a large. I just prefer this jacket to fit close to the body. It is long enough. I like the wide bottom band at the hips. The arms are cut small so definitely size up if your arms are larger. The material is stretchy but the cuffs at the wrist don't stretch as much. My only complaint because I like to push the sleeves up when needed. The hoodie actually is large enough to wear over your head with some room. It is sewn well and has a nylon zipper.

       "  'reviewText': 'I did not purchase my Gilmour Flexogen hoses from Amazon but had to put my two cents in.  I own four of the Gilmour Flexogen hoses in various lengths and they are by far the favorites out of my entire hose stable.  Two of the hoses are nearing 15 years old and are still in excellent condition.  The Gilmour Flexogen hoses are the only hoses I have owned (and I have owned a lot of hoses over the years) that have rarely kinked.  They are very easy to wind on a hose reel or curl in a tight circle on the ground.  They are not that heavy - older people and ladies should not have much trouble managing 50 or 100 feet of these hoses.  My Gilmours are used on an outside well for maintaining a shallow pond and landscaping/vegetable garden. I had purchased the recycled Gatorhyde hose this summer instead of another Gilmour Flexogen.  The Gatorhyde hoses are nice in that they recycle materials, but are very expensive.  They are somewhat of a disappointment. I would rate Gatorhyde way below the Gilmour Flexogen hoses for two reasons: if you are not careful and unwind it in the direction it wants to go (and this must be done on a hot day to warm it up) it will kink, and although the Gatorhyde is fairly light-weight, it is a major hassle to wind. The Gatorhyde hose fights me every inch when I wind it out of the way for mowing or store it away for the winter.  It absolutely refuses to wind up in small neat circles without kinking, which is annoying, and takes up too much space in the barn. Whenever I need another hose, it will be the dependable Gilmour Flexogen hoses.UPDATE:  May 30, 2013  Found another gem of a hose, the Tuff-Guard Never Kink.  Bought the 100 foot length (bright blue is the only color for that size) and it is wonderful.  It DOES NOT KINK!  Rolls up compactly into small loops and is the lightest hose I have ever used.  Gilmour is still a fantastic product and I will continue to use my faithful Gilmour hoses until they wear out.  But if you are looking for a truly light-weight hose that NEVER KINKS, I recommend the Tuff-Guard hoses.',\n",

It begins with coverage of ships from before the time of HMS Dreadnought (like the Monitor, the Great White Fleet) and covers the HMS Dreadnought and the ships immediately following it. Then it covers the battle of Jutland pretty well and the effect of the Washington Naval Treaty had on the number and size of the battleships. The period of World War 2 was well covered with the development of the American, British, German and Japanese (Yamato especially) battleships. The rise of the airplane is covered with the chase of the Bismarck and of the attack on Pearl Harbor but the program keeps its focus on the battleships pretty well. It then goes into the Cold War history of the Iowa class battleships during the Korean and Vietnam Wars, the reintroduction of the Iowa class during the Reagan Administration's defense buildup of the 1980's. The explosion aboard the Iowa battleship could have had more coverage but was well handled. Finally, it ends with the combat history of the battleship during the Gulf War and of the dedication of the USS Missouri in Pearl Harbor. Great program!

       "  'reviewText': \"I recently got the chance to test and compare both the Philips NP2900 and the Logitech SqueezeBox Boom Streaming Internet Streaming Radio units together side-by-side. If you were just to test each unit individually, you would be impressed by either unit but head-to-head, I noticed distinct pros and cons with each unit.The first thing you'll notice different between the two units is the styling. The Philips NP2900 is a very stylish looking unit with its metal construction, brilliant color LCD color screen and nice round corners which just looks sexy. Compared to the Logitech SqueezeBox Boom, with its plastic construction, more utilitarian green LED screen, bulkier square design and bigger size, the Philips unit just plain looks and feels better. The remote control on the Philips also looks and feels more like a hi-fi remote whereas the Logitech's remote is a small, simple remote that you'll probably lose pretty quickly since it's so small. The only real complaint I had with the Philips remote was that there was no page up/page down function makes scrolling thru long playlists a pain. Considering the backgrounds of the two companies, it was obvious the Logitech was designed with a PC in mind while the Philips unit was designed with more of a standalone, CE mindset.As for the setup, both units were easy to setup with each unit finding my Wi-Fi connection quickly and entering the WEP security key a breeze. I was up and running on both units within 5 minutes of unboxing them and was scanning for and listening to Internet radio stations with ease. Since I had them side-by-side, I tested the same Internet radio stations playing simultaneously on both. I had a few friends and family over so we all listened to each unit playing the same radio stations and compared the two. I then took a vote from the group of five to get their opinion for which sounded better. Everybody agreed including myself that the Logitech unit did sound better and on inspecting both units' speakers, you could see why. The Logitech unit had two bigger main woofer  speaker cones and two tweeters while the Philips unit had two smaller woofer speaker cones and no tweeter. The Logitech unit was also quite a bit heavier and most audiophiles will tell you that the heavier the amplifiers/speakers, the better the sound. This is not to say that the Philips unit sounded bad as it still sounded great and if we did not have the Logitech unit side-by-side, I am sure everyone would have been more than satisfied with the Philips' sound. Anyway, if you don't like the speakers, you can always plug your own in the back thru stereo RCA jacks or headphone jacks. Overall, the sound on the Logitech just sounded fuller with more bass and dynamic range.As for software, Philips comes with software from Twonky Media which turns your PC into a uPnP server so that the NP2900 can see and play music from your PC. The Logitech came with its own proprietary software that pretty much did the same thing. The one thing that the Logitech had that the Philips unit didn't was the ability to control the unit over the Web thru a standard browser. This was a pretty cool feature as you can adjust the volume and controls from the Internet on the Logitech unit whereas the Philips unit required using the remote only. For online services, the Philips let's you access Rhapsody but after the first month, you'll have to buy a subscription which is $12.99. Logitech can access Rhapsody for a fee, but can also access services such as Sirius and Pandora so it gives you more options in that regard. Since I really love the Pandora service, the Logitech gives me more options here.The bottom line is that both units are great units that most people would be more than happy with. Depending on what you want though, each unit is designed for different tastes. If you want a stylish, sexy hi-fi unit that is going to make your interior designer happy, the Philips unit is definitely the one. If you are more utilitarian and want the unit that sounds better and has more ways to control it, the Logitech unit is the one for you. As far as price, the Logitech unit is also about $75 cheaper so if price is a factor, the Logitech unit does everything the Philips unit does. If price is not an issue, then the Philips unit just looks hotter, almost like a piece of art.\",\n",

He then follows their life stories until they intersect, and goes on to recount their ten-year relationship and eventual marriage.The interesting thing about their relationship was that it was the first time a high-ranking member of the Royal family, or \"The Firm\" as they like to be called in England, married a commoner and is still on his way to become king. Prince William\\'s own mother, Diana Spencer, was even more blue-blooded than Charles. But as he witnessed the breakup of his parents\\' marriage, the thing that William grew to understand is that the aristocratic standing of his partner meant nothing, if he did not love her.Enter Kate: a girl from a self-made millionaire family (who made their fortune creating goodie bags for children\\'s birthday parties) and from a working-class background (her uncle is a drug dealer, her mother was an airplane stewardess). Anderson describes in detail the strategies she used in her relationship with William (wearing a provocative outfit in the student fashion show--which catches William\\'s attention and leads him to invite her to become his roommate, ingratiating herself with the Royal family without overplaying her card, invoking William\\'s jealousy during their period apart, and much more), while tracing William\\'s training in the army, navy, and aviation.Overall, I thought Anderson did a good job with this. I am not predisposed to read anymore William and Kate books, as he answered all of my questions. Recommended for anyone looking to learn more about the future King and Queen.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This review and the three stars are not so much for this particular X-10 device but for X-10 as a system.X-10 is still just about the cheapest home automation product that exists. However it is not without its drawbacks. Most of these are caused by modern equipment and devices that were not even dreamed of when X-10 was designed.When it works, it can be wonderful. But the X-10 powerline signaling mechanism was designed in the late 70s. This means it predates switch-mode power supplies (which are universal in home computers and laptops, are used in most modern \"power bricks\" and \"wall warts\", and are also used in much other modern gear), WiFi, compact fluorescent lamps, LED lamps, UPSs, and even surge protector power strips.Most of the above types of devices generate noise on the power line, and this noise can interfere with X-10\\'s signals.Others actively *filter out* the X-10 signal. It is important to understand that the X-10 signals are sent during the \"zero-crossing\" period of the AC power waveform. They are weak (low voltage) signals well outside the AC power frequency range.In other words, when seen in an otherwise pure AC waveform, X-10 signals look like noise! So the noise filters in things like \"surge protector\" power strips, and even in much electronic equipment, will therefore reduce or even eliminate the X-10 signal! It\\'s not their fault - it\\'s what they\\'re *supposed* to do.And the more surge protector strips you have in your home, the worse this gets. Note that this does not apply only to the equipment that is plugged into the power strip. It also will likely apply to stuff plugged into the same outlet as a power strip, or even to nearby outlets on the same circuit.As a result of both increasing numbers of electrically noisy devices, and increasing numbers of \"surge suppressor\" power strips, X-10 has been getting less and less reliable over the years in many users\\' homes. This has nothing to do with the X-10 modules or controllers. They\\'re the same as ever. It\\'s the other stuff in our houses and this is only going to get worse.You can have a setup that works perfectly most of the time... and then mysteriously starts ignoring signals from one particular controller. Or one module will start ignoring commands. Later it will just as mysteriously work perfectly again. In my experience these problems are usually caused by a \"noisy\" device, like a laptop with a particularly noisy power brick, that is plugged in or switched on sometimes and not at other times.Moving the affected controller or module to another outlet - especially one on a different circuit - will sometimes help, sometimes make the problem worse. Occasionally, *adding* a particular appliance or lamp to the house will make X-10 work *better*. And so it goes.Conclusion: For X-10 to work is no longer the \"slam dunk\" assumption it was decades ago (yes, decades!) when the system was introduced. If you want much more reliable home automation you\\'re going to have to go to something else, like Z-wave. Of course that will be much more expensive, but... life is full of those tradeoffs.',\n",

Everyone stoped bringing it to class after the second week, because the only times it was useful were those rare occasions when we had designers block and needed to jack someone else's full-color idea.Now I am the kind of person who likes to horde all kinds of books, but I sold The Web Design Wow Book at the campus bookstore (only got a couple bucks for it because, surprise, it was never used in any other classes) because I was embarrassed to have it on my shelf.People learning how to design interfaces or looking for inspiration would be much better off with something like Web Pages That Suck or Edward Tufte's Envisioning Information.\",\n",

It's a how-to book for young children who want to be the best babysitters for their grandpas; they learn how to greet, feed, walk and entertain their grandpas while acting as grandpa-sitters. Also, it's the story of a little boy being babysat by his fun and loving grandpa. It's funny and clever, and both kid and adult readers will probably find it amusing.Although it's a short book, being for young children and all, the author is still able to give the characters a lot of personality. The little boy has a big imagination, and he's rambunctious, spirited and kind while the grandpa is warm, caring and willing to be a little silly and goofy with his grandkid. The boy's love of playing pretend was a great touch, and I liked how he included his grandpa in his games, showing young readers that grandparents can be a lot of fun too.The illustrations are very well-done, and every time you read it, you can pick out things you might have missed before. My favorite little detail is the inclusion of a pair of conniving little lizards who don't like the grandpa. If you wanted to add another element to reading the story aloud, you could easily play I-Spy-The-Lizards if you were reading this book with a child!This book is an awesome book for any kid who is going to be staying behind with a babysitter, but it is an especially good book for grandparents to read with their grandkids or perhaps for teachers to read on grandparent visitation days. It's a cute, silly book that will make kids giggle.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'It took me a long time to buy \"Good Gouls Do\" even though I fell in love with \"A Good Ghouls Guide To Getting Even\".  That is due to the fact that a trip to Julie Kenner\\'s website revealed no plans for a third installment.  She said she hopes one day to finish Beth\\'s story but there are no real plans to do so.  I hate stories that end in a cliffhanger about as much as I hate TV shows that end on a cliffhanger and then aren\\'t renewed for the next season.  Yeah, that\\'s bad.  But being a huge Kenner fan and also a Beth fan, I had to pick up this book.  I am both tremendously glad and sad that I did.  This story picks up right after the first one.  Beth is a vampire who is also in line to be her class valedictorian.  Due to being tricked by the football team and forced to drink blood, Beth is now a blood drinker.  Someone out there is her master and Beth needs to find out who it is.  If she can kill her master, than she can become human again.  She has to do all this while trying to avoid getting staked because someone is after her.  It may be her boyfriend Clayton, who she had to turn recently to keep him from dying.  Since she is his master, killing her may be Clayton\\'s only hope of becoming human again.  This easy to read story literally flew by...every page is packed with action and Beth\\'s adorable wit.  This is a strong, fun teenager, and a great example for pre-teens and teens to look up to.  For adults like myself, it is still a fun read.  The sad part is having to wonder how Beth\\'s story will end.  \"Good Ghouls Do\" left a ton of unanswered questions.  It would be nice if Kenner could find some way to wrap these up?  If there is no chance for a final book, perhaps she could work Beth\\'s conclusion into a short story in an anthology or something.',\n",

Rabbi Dosick skillfully wrote this book to make: the Jew who is being drawn to the faith of their ancestors, the proselyte who has been drawn to Judaism through their own personal journey or through a maritial relationship, and the Christian who is interested in its mother faith feel welcome. This is no small accomplishment.This is a textbook without the boring text. It is an instruction manual with easy to read directions.

       "  'reviewText': 'I absolutely agree with almost everything Mr. Parker writes, including the excellence of the Delm&eacute; Quartet which immediately prompted me to order by this ensemble another disc (Bach\\'s Art of Fugue; the other works available by them don\\'t interest me enough to spend even more money or I have already several interpretations of them. Of the Art of Fugue too, even played on string quartet, but now I MUST hear this monumental music by the Delm&eacute;\\'s!).The playing of the Delm&eacute; Quartet is really celestial, without the fallacious stereotyped sweet-shop beauty of old, realized by excessive tremolo and unnecessary portamento passages between notes, from which even many famous modern ensembles are still not entirely exempt. Their style is elegant but, what is more important, it is dignified and intelligent.What I don\\'t fully agree with are secondary statements. The first sentence of the review could be said about Schubert as well. \"Biedermeyer note-spinning\" is a lucky expression but Biedermeyer is not necessarily bad. Brahms is sometimes not far from it, eg. in his Clarinet Trio, or even in his first Cello Sonata, however great it is otherwise. Hummel\\'s Cello Sonata may not be great but it does not lack beauty.While it is not untrue that \"this composer\\'s music is disconcertingly uneven\", and more so than usual, one must admit that only the music of a handful of exceptional composers is not uneven: perhaps Bach\\'s, Haydn\\'s, Brahms\\'... As to the main point, \"[Hummel\\'s music] at its best is as good as anything among works in the canon of the \"standard repertory\", it is absolutely my own opinion too.These were only nuances. But the slighting of Hummel\\'s piano music frankly dumbfounds me. Hummel\\'s most \"exalted height of musical splendour\" is precisely a piano sonata, the titanic F sharp minor, and there are other astonishing pieces, like the Fantasies Op. 18 and 123 (anticipating Schumann and Liszt, by the way, but not astonishing because of that), magnificently performed by a Madoka Inui with a perfect feeling of their character, or the not titanic but on the contrary \"Biedermeyer\" op. 92 for four hands. A Rondo brillante Op. 109 and two (actually one single) Pot-pourris Op. 58 & 59 are also captivating, in spite of the little convincing quality of the available performances, which don\\'t bring into relief the true sense of these unconventional works. I suppose that among the many other unrecorded solo piano works several are worth unearthing, as well as among the various pieces of ballet and pantomime music with tantalizing titles like The Magic Ring or Harlequin as a Spider, or Der Zauberkampf (The Magic Fight).I don\\'t understand why the sleeve-notes, which are or should be an important source of information for the layman, can\\'t avoid humdrum wisdom. Like here: \"Hummel\\'s String quartets ... were composed in the wake of Beethoven\\'s revolutionary Opus 18 Quartets.\" The author is evidently an expert. Another expert, John N. Burk, writes in his book on Beethoven: \"Certainly no one, even Beethoven, could have borrowed that elegant investiture of a closing century and worn it with the consummate grace of those two [Haydn and Mozart] who made it so completely a part of their natures ... The texture, at its best, is richer ... But the old-time air of formal correctness hang over them ... There are moments when one asks whether the composer of the piano sonatas Opus 10 and 14 has relapsed into cautiousness...\" etc. Now one wonders which of the experts is right. Revolution or old-time air of correctness? I guess that he who says revolution, just like he who sais that \"Hummel links Mozart to Chopin bypassing Beethoven\" and the like, can not be right since such talk amounts to say that 4 is the link between 3 and 5. Truisms can be not only insipid but also untrue. Beethoven = good. Revolution = good. Therefore Beethoven = revolution. I feel on the contrary that, whichever of the two sets, Beethoven\\'s or Hummel\\'s, is greater, with respect to the spirit (as opposed to the compositional element) Hummel\\'s is more original, less \"in the wake of\" Haydn and Mozart, and not at all in the wake of Beethoven. But the main point is that a composer is not great because he obeys to the rail schedules of music history or runs faster than the train.',\n",

There's plenty of action, some romance, and what might be viewed as an unconventional commentary on our current political situation here in the US. I first read the book in one sitting, during an inter-continental flight. Because of numerous intricate plot twists, I later re-read, and better understood, several chapters. I was sorry when I reached the end of the book, and it seems that another book should be written to pick up where this one left off (I look forward to it!). &#34;Sure Cure&#34; offers much more than the typical &#34;action fiction&#34; novel. To enjoy it, one must approach it with an open mind, and must be willing to embrace concepts such as &#34;suspended&#34; or &#34;frozen time&#34; and &#34;mind change&#34; and &#34;mind transfer&#34;- -  I found it to be a pleasurable combination of &#34;science fiction&#34; and action.\",\n",

I have to say, I really liked this book. It is not for everyone though, as you can see by other reviews. It is vulgar and hard to follow at points, but in my opinion these things only add to the wildness of the main character who I found fascinating.Henry is a licentious and rebellious person who cannot get enough out of life and seems to be running around causing trouble throughout the entire book. I cannot relate to him at all, but that is part of the fun. It's a wild ride, but it also teaches you a lot about the main players and events of the Irish War of Independence. It also shows you the absurdities of war, and that in war there it is nearly impossible to determine who is good and who is bad.Some might say Henry is full of himself, but to me it seems like he just has a really good idea of who he is, and isn't afraid to let you know. I think it is also a survival technique -a person living in constant danger needs a lot of self confidence to live. He also seems to be about double his age throughout the book, which I think can be attributed to the fact that he grew up in poverty and had to grow up fast.There were moments when I considered putting it down for another book, but I'm glad I stuck with it because at the end of it I was thoroughly satisfied and looking for my next Roddy Doyle book to read.\",\n",

I travel a lot for business and usually carry my own trusted brand as usually the brands/types of shampoo/conditioner within hotels are not the best and leave my hair dry and difficult to manage.  I have very long and thick hair, so brushing and hair drying alone can be a challenge without the added issues of the wrong shampoo/conditioner.I believe I ran out of my own shampoo/conditioner while staying at the hotel and had resolved to trying Hiltons PTR brand.  It was a late night for me after a long day with the client, and I was so tired, all I could do was shower, brush my hair and get to bed...no blowdrying...which is typically a no no for me with my long crazy hair as it is.  Regardless, I woke up the next morning shocked to see my hair with amazing body and richness.  I believe I stayed shocked all day and came back to the hotel and loaded up on the PTR sample sizes the hotel had.  I have been an avid user ever since and refuse to go back to anything else!  My friends have even commented on how my hair looks on the most rough and tumble days (hiking, biking, swimming, running, etc.).I love the PTR shampoo and conditioner, and while the price is steep, it is still cheaper than what most salons have/charge for those brands and they don't do near as much as what PTR does for me!\",\n",

It appears that they are.I live in a one-bedroom apartment approximately 15 minutes away from campus, and having the ability to switch off the lights from my Android phone and iPhone saves me some time when I head out of the house to class in the morning.  (I run a low-power Atom/Ion-based server with X10 Commander, connected to an ActiveHome Pro module)  I do enjoy that I can shut off the lights from anywhere to save money on my expensive monthly electric bill (since I live by myself, $50/mo feels unacceptable).I\\'m a bit of a nerd, so I try to offset the electricity I use with my home theater (I often forget to shut this off/put it in sleep mode), gaming rig (in standby most of the time), and my appreciation for brightly lit rooms when I\\'m doing problem sets late at night (low-K compact fluorescents and halogens only).I\\'ve learned that in lamps with shades (even with CFLs), the Socket Rockets work great.  The Lamp Module works great with my halogen desklamp.  But for the LED strip lighting I put over my sink (no switch, since I use a RadioShack power supply!) I needed the AM466.  Ditto for any gooseneck lamps, since the socket rocket makes the bulb protrude too far.  If you put many varieties of CFL on the lamp modules, they will flicker and buzz horribly.  Dimmable CFLs do NOT work well with the lamp modules, since while dimmed, they introduce line noise which renders them uncontrollable.As for reliability, one Socket Rocket failed to program/function until I screwed it in very hard, bending the contacts inside the unit into place.  I also had an issue with a specific code and a specific AM466 in my house, but I resolved that by numbering it out of sequence, changing it from A9 to A13.  I can\\'t figure out what exactly caused that issue.  Lastly, the keychain remote has pretty good range, but one of my credit card remotes is basically useless.The frustrating thing about X10 (since it\\'s not built into appliances) is that if you control a lamp or appliance from X10, you cannot also control it by its built-in switch.  Hence the remotes.That said, I won\\'t consider an alternative, since the prices the competition charge make home automation out of my price range.  Also, the ubiquity and old age of X10 means that there are random projects that support it, i.e. Mac and Linux support if that\\'s what floats your boat.In conclusion, go with X10, but don\\'t expect a flawless experience unless you want to spend more.

       "  'reviewText': \"David Slattery-Christy is a writer very much in tune with British society during the first half of the last century. His plays, including two based on true stories (Forever Nineteen, partly set in WW1 which he's currently hoping to revive for next year's centenary; and The Postcard, about an Irish immigrant on The Titanic) enjoyed runs in London and New York.  Of special interest to Sardines readers, may be his excellent revised version of the libretto for the first of Ivor Novello's eight spectacular musicals, Glamorous Night (1935), in a way that makes it accessible for companies today.Working on that, directing the celebratory 50th Anniversary Concert of Novello's life and work at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and acting as the Novello consultant on Robert Altman's Gosford Park, not to mention contributing to the BBC documentary Novello The Handsomest Man In Britain, has led to David developing a special bond with the ghost of Ivor Novello and his world.  It has served him brilliantly with his two, well-researched biographies, of both Novello (In Search of Ruritania) and his contemporary Lily Elsie (Anything But Merry!)David has an amazing gift for bringing back to life the bustle and allure of London's West End in the days of Daly's, The Gaiety and beyond; above all, the personalities who illuminated them whose charismas have very inadequately been captured by recordings. The DVD of Novello in the 1932 film of his play I Lived With You gives, perhaps, the best idea of his light, comedic touch; whilst only a few scratchy, mono recordings survive of Elsie's glorious voice.To women of my mother's generation Novello was a god.  Even if they'd heard - and then, understood - the rumours that he wasn't actually romantically involved with Gladys Cooper et al, but had a male partner, (though the word `Gay' was not used then) and bedded just about any attractive young man within his orbit, they brushed it aside, worshipping him for his looks, glamour and unique brand of escapism.  The book sheds more light than ever before on the bohemian world of Novello, Coward and their contemporaries in a way that is both chatty - yet scholarly.He makes a good case for Novello being the Andrew Lloyd Webber of his day, his popular, personality-dominated fare `filling the plush', making London theatre less elitist and available to a wider social spectrum than ever before.  And he truly captures the soul of the man. The atmospheric description of his visit to Novello's house Redroofs in Berkshire, is particularly moving.At last one has a good idea of the real Novello, freed from the damaging airbrushed portraits of earlier, sentimentalised biographies. The man was full of contradictions. For all his apparent chutzpah and charm, he had a depressive side, and despite a normally good business head, could be amazingly nave and head-in-the-sand, as when he found himself with a prison sentence during WW2 for accepting illicit petrol from a fan.Novello's soaring waltzes and ballads set to Christopher Hassall's romantic lyrics are, for me, a bit like Belgian truffles: two at a time are bliss, more a bit rich. But this is not to knock Novello's fine musicianship and range as a composer, which includes a wide variety of songs and music that has been shamefully undervalued and neglected. It didn't help that he died at the peak of his powers, aged 58, in 1951, after arriving home from playing the lead in his own Kings Rhapsody. Concurrently with that show at The Palace, his other musical Gay's the Word was running just up the road.  This was a very different cuppa, with clever lyrics by Alan Melville showing Novello returning more to the witty revue style of his earlier years - whilst gently sending up, not only his own Ruritanian shows, but Oklahoma! and the new wave of slick American `musical plays'.What might he have done next?  Would he have been able to move with the times, or become a dodo - as Coward and Rattigan almost did before they were both rediscovered?  We shall never know.The adolescent Novello was a huge fan of Lily Elsie who made her name as Lehar's `Merry Widow' in 1907, going on to star also in A Waltz Dream, The Dollar Princess and The Count of Luxemburg. She later appeared opposite him in his play The Truth Game (1928).  Older by then, but still very attractive, it was to be her final stage appearance.You'd have thought such an incandescent performer would have been blessed with a fulfilling life.  But she was riddled with demons, tormented by stage fright and even her hoped-for happily-ever-after with a handsome, wealthy husband, ended in tatters. In the 1950s she had a lobotomy in an attempt to save her fragile mental health, but it only helped destroy her personality further. Nevertheless, Anything But Merry! successfully evokes the world of the Edwardian operettas and musical comedies, and reminds us of the life of one of its glittering, yet sadly forgotten performers - and the sometimes incalculable price of fame.For more information on David Slattery-Christy's plays and books:[...]'Book Ends' Review by Raymond Langford-Jones for Sardines Theatre Magazine - July 2013\",\n",

It's definitely a textbook (as opposed to some of the more enjoyable books on the same subject), so you sacrifice some readability for the dense content.Overall, I learned more from this book than any other one I had read, but I did slow way down and took notes on each chapter.

As others have noted, the burner valve control is not very sensitive and takes careful turning to get a low flame.And it does seem cheap - Coleman is only relying on their name now as this is not the robust product of old. The sheet metal is thin but decent quality, but the top lid hinges are cheap and on one side is flexing outward from the rivets.It\\'s probably fine for most, but priced too much for a product of this lower quality. $29 is closer to what I think it\\'s worth. Not sure what to recommend for better quality, but if want something a bit sturdier I\\'d be inclined to spend a few more dollars or search for another product.UPDATE Sept 01 2012. After 5 nights camping I am returning the stove .. the gas valves are hard to adjust to a low flame (as others have noted) and there valves have \"spring back\" too. Another camper had the \"Coleman PerfectFlow InstaStart 2-Burner Stove\" and the valves were not springy. I may consider that stove ... the BTU output of the stove is identical, the only useful difference is the better gas control.UPDATE Sept 22 2012. My return was processed. 5/5 stars for Amazon\\'s return process - excellent and efficient. After more research I am considering the \"Camp Chef Mountain Series 2 Burner/High Pressure Stove\".

I got the impression of a collage of factual information from reference books joined together to create a not very convincing story. The use of real historical figures confused me, was it a tale or an historical commentary, or both. In fairness it came across as an interesting political commentary, ie. the so-called heroes of the era being not much different than our current batch of politicians, shuffling for power and walking over any socialist ideas that stem from republicanism.

I love all the Bose products I've ever had and these are no exception.Sound quality is the Bose signature natural sounding acousitics.  The outside world melts away as I listen to music or audiobooks with these.  It's a very relaxing experience to wear these.  I had these on in a crowded shopping center the other day, on a Saturday, where the acousics amplify every voice and sound and child scream.  When I put these on, all that faded away into silence, and my music was mellow and was all I could hear.  These have the soft bass and perfect treble I  notice in all my Bose speakers.And these are incredibly comfortible.  I had tested out all the noise canceling headphones I could find in a few stores before I chose these Bose headphones.  I can wear these as many hours as I want to without ever really noticing I even have them on.  They are well  made out of high quality materials.  With Bose you do get what you pay for.  I wouldn't wear any other brand after these.\",\n",

I checked them both out at a Bose store after I had ordered them on Amazon, and I couldn't really hear the difference in the sound between the two. But the QC 3 is neater in it's design.It's got absolutely great sound and quite good sound cancelling performance. They are also by far the most comfortable, physically, of any head phones I have used. I used them for the first time on a 10 hrs intercontinental flight. I wore them during the entire flight, and only took them off occasionally just to feel the difference in background noise. I will never go on a flight without them again. I plugged them into the aircraft's sound outlet for the movies, and I only had to bring up the volume to a minimum compared to what I had to with the airline's own head phones. You can use them instead of earplugs. But they're quite expensive if noise cancelling is all that you need...But for daily use, it's a bit too bulky, and you're always worried that you will loose them. If you're a frequent flier, it's a must.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This was such a wonderful read for me. Beautifully written, thoroughly entertaining! It\\'s the story of four sisters whose lives were shattered with the abandoment of their mother and the effect it had on each one of them. Each girl reacted in her own way from pressing through the pain to silencing it away. Having lost my mother at a young age, I related to each one of them--one in particular. I believe the absence of someone has a greater impact on our lives than we care to mention causing each of us to \"sleep\" through life, settling for the mundane or the ordinary yet wanting more. I loved each character and that isn\\'t always the case for me but found it pleasantly surprising. I rooted for each one, hoping they would find what they wanted and needed. The author, Allison Pittman, has stated that this was such a fun story for her to write and we can believe that with every line, every page. I have to agree with her as it was such a fun story to read! Needless to say, if the Brooklyn Bridegrooms hadn\\'t come to town, The Allenhouse girls would still be sleeping.',\n",

I figured, all manufactured good can have a percentage of products with factory defect, no harm done.  The second Hose arrived on August 20, 2013.  On September 4, 2013 the second one exhibit the exact issue.  Called Amazon and they refunded my money.  I don't think two defective Hose in such a short time is a fluke and I'm tired of packing a hose to ship back every month.  I will now go back to doing research. In the mean time I have to water 14 planters,10sq feet of garden area with two, 2 gallon watering cans, let the fun begin.

The oven handle finish - which is also supposedly stainless steel - has already worn away to expose the gray plastic that it\\'s actually made of. Whatever the anodized finish over the plastic handle is made from, it can NOT be stainless steel.  We don\\'t even use the oven too much, but the finish is completely worn away on the right side of the handle where we grab it to open the oven.I just replaced the handle (search online for part #W10171750) for about $50, hoping that the new one will be more durable than the one that came with it.  Both the old and new handles appear to be made identically, so I don\\'t have high hopes for it, but time will tell.Back to the good: The convection oven bake feature is great! Put crinkle cut fries or \"Tator Tots\" on a pan with convection bake and the baked fries come out nice and crisp - almost like they were fried. Spray some sliced potatoes with olive oil and seasoned salt and they come out better than anything you can buy!The glass stove top is also nice.  Easy to clean, and the single/dual heating elements on the front two burners are extremely handy. We make a lot of stuff in big stainless steel and/or cast iron pots (like big pots of soup/stew that simmer for hours) and the flexibility to move pots around on the stovetop is great.Everything has held up well over the first year except the finish on the oven handle. It seems a bit ridiculous to need to replace a \"stainless steel\" handle after one year because the \"stainless steel\" finish has worn off to reveal the plastic underneath.',\n",

This unit has three key features that are an absolute must for home theater(performance and price  go without saying); 1)Dolby Digital &amp; DTS  ready -this is the main  reason to invest in home theater! 2) Full S-Video inputs for all components  -Video switching can be cumbersome unless your receiver and all your  components use the same video input/outputs (SVGA, RCA &amp; RF).  Buy this  unit with the intention of connecting all your components via SVGA for ease  of operation and superb picture quality.  3) Digital Audio input Mapping  -Sounds technical but it simply allows you to address the receiver optical  inputs to your match your equipment.  What all this means is that this  receiver has all the flexibility to support whatever components you have  today and any you decide to upgrade/add tomorrow.  I tried out two other  receivers before zeroing in on this one.The only downside(as also  mentioned by another reviewer)is that the unit is somewhat of a technical  challenge to master. JVC operation manuals tend to be a little brief and  cryptic in their explainations.  This one is better than most but you must  read the manual (probably more than once)when you set this unit up or it  will not function properly.  (e.g., In addition to all the cabling, Dolby  Digital sound requires proper DVD I/O mapping plus the DVD player must be  set to output the proper digital data stream.)In all the units I've  seen, this one is far and away the best equipped, and for the money, its an  obvious top choice.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Here\\'s what my son and I have to say:SON SAYS:What I liked and disliked about:I\\'ve read lots of dinosaur books before but this one taught me new things like dinosaurs didn\\'t have fur and I learned about what they ate.  They also talked about dinosaurs I had never heard of before like the Buitreraptor.  I had also never seen the Microraptor before.  I thought it was cool that they showed how big a dinosaur was compared to a person.  When I saw the picture of the Argentinosaurus, I thought it was an elephant with no face. I also didn\\'t know that a T-Rex\\'s tooth makes a good knife.My favorite dinosaur is the Ankylosaurus because it\\'s cool how it has spikes and a hammer tail thingy-ma-jigger.  My second favorite dinosaur is the Triceratops because it\\'s cool how it has giant horns and a shield on its head and it\\'s funny that it has a mouth like a beak.  My third favorite is the Stegosaurus because it\\'s cool how it looks like it has leaves on its back.  My fourth favorite dinosaur is the T-Rex because it\\'s the biggest meat eater. My fifth favorite is the Edmontosaurus because they can make a stampede when there\\'s a bunch together running.There is nothing I didn\\'t like about the book.My bottom line:I loved, loved, loved this book.  I would recommend it to little boys my age or 6 years old.MOM SAYS:What I liked and disliked about:For followers of our reviews, you\\'ll note that this book was featured as one of the selections in the Children\\'s Non-Fiction week of our Summer Reading Weekly Book Giveaways. Well, Lo and Behold! What should we spot on our latest visit to the library but National Geographic Kids: Dinosaurs! :DWell, my son and I got pretty excited when we saw this book and did not fail to deliver! As mentioned by my son above, we have read several dinosaur books, but I would rate this one at the very top.  It provides the right combination of real photographs of Paleontologists digging up fossils of dinosaur bones and coloured illustrations of 15 different dinosaurs representing the well known (e.g., T-Rex, Triceratops) and some we had never run across before (e.g., Microraptor, Anchiornis).But I think that what really sets this book apart from other dinosaur books that we\\'ve read is that there seems to be just the right amount of information.  I find that most dinosaur books have so much detail about each dinosaur that it is quite easy for kids to quickly lose interest.  In this book, they provide very basic facts about some of the more popular dinosaurs:\"Tyrannosaurus rex (ty-RAN-oh-SORE-us REX) was one of the biggest meat-eaters that ever walked the Earth.Triceratops (tri-SER-a-tops) had a huge head with three large horns and a wide neck frill.Anklylosaurus (AN-kye-loh-SORE-us) was an armored dinosaur. It had a solid bone club at the end of its tail.\"Oh, and can I just say that I appreciate the help with the pronunciation of some of these beasts?  Well, that just might be the French in me with all the funny accents in the wrong place coming out!Interestingly, when my son was discussing his favorite dinosaurs above and the reasons why they were his favorite, these are exactly the features that he remembered. Further, with regards to the information provided, there are unique scientific facts about dinosaurs presented in this book and they are presented in very simplified, easy-to-remember ways.\"Dinosaur Skin: Sometimes dinosaur skin left prints in mud. The mud hardened and saved the prints. These fossils tell us that some dinosaurs were scaly, like lizards. And some dinosaurs had feathers, like birds. [PHOTOS  AND ILLUSTRATIONS PROVIDED].\"Worthy of a quick mention is that there is a glossary of some of the terms used in the book at the very back: extinct, fossil, museum, and Paleontologist.  Nice touch!My bottom line:My son and I really, really, really enjoyed this book.  For his age group, I would say that this is THE dinosaur book.  I would recommend it to young dinosaur lovers aged 4+.',\n",

I have been healing finally, but very stiff.  After sleeping or sitting, I walk like an 80 year old until I get loosened up.  I am now 6 months out from my 3rd surgery.  Fusing well, and wishing to strengthen my core muscles and get back to more of my regular life.  (I just turned 41).This dvd is very beneficial.  It is broken up into 2 15 minute sections.  I started off just doing the first 15 minutes, which involves simply relaxation and stretching.  Of course I am paranoid to ever hurt my back again or herniate another disc, so I was worried that any program might be too strenuous for back surgery patients.  This one is not.  I love the feeling I have in my back, shoulders, hips and really entire body after these sessions.The second 15 minutes is a little tougher, and my body can't quite do exactly what is suggested, but I don't push my self.  I go very slowly and just enjoy the beginnings of flexibility and a decrease in stiffness and pain.All back surgery patients know that the key to future back health is to have our core muscles strengthened and doing their jobs.  I was out of commission for over 16 months and my core muscles have been on permanent vacation for quite a while.  I am excited with this dvd and look forward every morning to the experience.\",\n",

At the price, it was a small risk to take, as I confess I never watched NYPD Blue when it was on TV.The first couple of episodes got me interested. Three more and I was hooked. I especially like Caruso as Det. John Kelly, but this is a series with only the highest class drama. Each episode seems to advance one long term story, plus tackling one major and also a minor self-contained story. There is the inevitable love interest, but it never gets tacky like in 'Grey's Anatomy.'Although the show depicts New York in the 1990s, the whole show is in no danger of feeling outdated. Crisp writing, thoughtful plots and some very neat camera work keep the action rolling and the characters totally plausible.It's my favorite series after the early ER shows, because it shares quality, tension and a great feel of realism. The big question is whether to order series 2, as Caruso leaves and I wonder if he can really be replaced.\",\n",

I must use sytling spray before rolling and clipping but not inconvenient and the results are fantastic.  Dont give up on this one.  The metal clips of 20 years ago I used caused breakage and slipends - these clips are awesome.  It took a few tries to get it to to work for me but I couldnt get ready for work with them.  Excellent Product so glad i got it - if they ever go which electric rollers dont last for ever - I hope this product is still around.  i tried to save money and buy cheap - ended up spending way more money trying to find a good prouct that works.

Decided to buy one at the local hobby shop for 59.99 and took advantage of a 10% one day deal. Comes with extra blades, rtf, does 3D with precision, amazing acrobatics at full speed once you have full control of 4 channel transmitter.One word of caution, like with any Qcopter, because it looks the same from all side, make a note of its direction. Remember if you move left and it goes to the right then its coming towards you. It gets tricky when its flying left or right and not very aware if its flying away by gusts or winds or coming towards you.It can be flown outdoors on light moderate winds, more than that and this copter will pick up altitude in a flick of an eye. You can kill power in mid air, let it drop and it will recover over a nice hover immediately. I had read it was good for outdoors, my V911 flybar heli has a fight on even the slighest wind, I am on my 3rd as I already lost two. Wanted to do some flying outdoors without breaking the bank and the EZ fly was a perfect choice.Very durable, have crashed it a few times and have not broken any parts yet. I highly recommend to fly on a park when you are learning as it WILL go fast when hit with gusts of wind. I dont know what it is, but when it is dialed and flies like butter is like you are in the zone, almost therapeutic. It glides thru the wind smoothly, very quiet and stealth maneuvers.I highly recommend to anyone testing the waters on quadcopters.',\n",

It has proven reliable over 2-3 months, it runs cool (no heat problem), and it requires little or no attention.  I did have to reset it once;  that is, I had a connectivity problem that was not cured by resetting my router, so I reset the cable-modem.  Using the power button on the front did not make a difference, but I unplugged power for a few seconds and that fixed the connection.  Other than that, no issues at all.  I will note that the unit strikes me as a little bulky (that bulge you see on the left in the photo), and I can't wall-mount the device - minor nits overall.  To recap, if I can get it at a good price, I'd buy it.\",\n",

After rewatching the first episode, I realized something: They don't make 'em like this any more! The cast is fabulous, especially Dennis Franz as Sipowicz. The dialogue is gritty and real. As much as current cop dramas are allowed to use words that were once banned, NYPD broke ground with creative language and even use of the N-word when the plot justified it. Hard to watch sometimes, but the fast-moving plot combined with the background music and quick edits keep you watching. It's also fun to recognize bit players who have become stars (Anna Gunn from Breaking Bad, for example). The only caveat I give is that once you start watching be prepared to spend all your free time glued to your tv, kindle, whatever you have. I am up to season 1, episode 18, and can't wait to get back to the 15th Precinct!\",\n",

It has literally ended my disabling back pain quickly on more than one occasion.I started having episodes of severe back pain shortly after giving birth.  I had multiple specialists and exams.  The doctor was willing to give me lots of pain meds, but they just dulled the pain a bit for a couple hours and then I was in even worse misery.  I got this video as a desperate effort to avoid back surgery... it worked.I\\'ve had this video for several years now and I feel like I should be sending this woman a payment every time I use it.  I\\'ve got from having constant, immobilizing pain to occasional episodes (like once a year) that clear up within a couple uses of this video.I had been in a lot of pain this last week-- unable to bend over or stand up straight or roll over in bed-- and nothing was helping.  I found my \"Back in Shape\" dvd and popped it in.  After about 20 minutes of the video, I could stand straight again and bend with minimal pain.  Just finished day 2, second time through session 1, and I have almost no pain.  I\\'ll used it a few more times in the coming days, and then it will go on the shelf until I need it again.It\\'s an incredible video and I hope you\\'ll try it if you have back pain.  I never in a million years would have thought it could be so effective so quickly.Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you, lady with the long braid who makes the pain go away!!!',\n",

He is given beautiful women to take care of his loneliness and pills that relieve all his pains and worries.He meets every day with a psychiatrist.  As the story progresses, Sebastian learns he had committed some dastardly crime and was then brought to the facility to have knowledge of the crime, and his reasons for doing bad things &quot;erased&quot; from his mind in an effort to make him a model citizan.  This &quot;cure&quot; has also robbed him of a great deal of his life's  memories.The facility turns out to be more than a hospitial.  Everyone there is a prisoner with all their actions and conversations monitored.  Persons that accidently straggle into the facility are &quot;taken care of.&quot;  That is all I will to say about the plot without spoiling the ending.I enjoyed this book immensely.  It raises the question whether one's personal freedom is more important than having a life of bliss.  Should one rebel and try to escape or just not ask questions and go with the flow.It also raises the question as to whether mind conditioning for criminals (also like A Clockwork Orange) is a viable alternative to general incarceration.Amazon show that this book is out of print.

This new collection of manga contains the story told in the anime, which is one of my all time favorites, so of course I had to get them for my collection.Not only is the story based on real historical figures, it has classic elements: revenge, adventure, growing pains, and love. Our hero, 15 year old Tetsu, goes through so much in his attempt to avenge his parents' deaths. Fortunately, he has his overly protective big brother and members of the Shinsengumi to nudge him in the right direction.The art is clean. The words are powerful. There is a lot of humor within these pages, but there is also fear, loss, and terror for little Tetsu and his new family. If you want to learn a little about Japan's past and be drawn into a wonderful story, this is a manga not to be missed. Hopefully the sequel (which has been put on hiatis after only 3 excellent issues) will pick up where it left off.\",\n",

The beginning chapters&#8217; bare analogies, not far removed from events of politics occurring in 2013. The citizenry of a blind, unconditional following democracy are potential pawns to tyrannical zealots. .When individual moral conscious, is replaced by fear of repercussion, where constitutional guarantees are eroded by supreme executive powers and orders of a politic, the seeds of dictatorship are sown.These were fractional examples of the rise to power of recent histories human nightmares - National Socialism and the Gestapo.The culmination of horror at the behest of diabolical, fanatical, self serving narcissists, led millions to their deaths, and untold millions more to dehumanizing torture, conquest, and subservience, as one political party enslaved the greater portion of the world&#8217;s democracies.This book is an in-depth study of extreme political science, and should be considered a paradox to what we now teach in modern sociology.Highly recommend this book to any person whose genuine moral conscious is to preserve the absolute divine dignity of humanity; to teach present and future generations of their obligations to liberty, freedom, and justice; and additionally to those whose ambitions compel them to seek elected leadership.The terrible legacy of National Socialism portrayed in the tremendous book forced this reader to often put the book down for a while, since it sickened this reader as to how low multitudes of monsters could passively endorse multi-continental  genocide and slavery. It also reaffirmed that history will repeat itself, unless today&#8217;s generations are educated, and are resolved to avoid the dibolical advances of totalitarianism.The duplicity of political correctness clearly began with the Nazi Party. The ideology of plausible deniability was also spawned by the Nazi leadership, and greedy, prejudicial, and uneducated populations fell, hungrily, for these initial deceptions.People did not vote their conscious, they voted for Party and for superiority of doctrine. Through their complicity they were equally guilty of supporting crimes against humanity; their cowardice to fight for freedom cost them the unconditional surrender to the evils of dictatorial absolutism.This book should be a must read for sociology students, book clubs, and aspiring politicians.

       "  'reviewText': '\"Twilight of the Idols\" and \"The Anti-Christ\" are two of the last books, both composed in 1888, that Nietzsche wrote before his final descent into syphilis-induced madness which occurred during the first week of 1889.  They continue themes he had developed in his earlier work, and \"The Anti-Christ\" especially approaches Christianity with a particularly ferocious and critical eye.As anyone who has thumbed through a volume of Nietzsche can tell you, his work isn\\'t composed of clear, well-defined propositions to be ultimately accepted or rejected; instead, his arguments have a kind of ravishing rhetorical force to them.  His writing is less apothegmatic here than in other work, but is still never syllogistic or ratiocinated in such a way that we usually associate with philosophy.  This isn\\'t a mistake; he intended his work to speak as much if not more through the force of style than anything else.  In his \"attack\" on Socrates in the first book, he calls reason itself a \"tyrant,\" and wonders if Socrates enjoys his \"own form of ferocity in the knife-thrust of the syllogism.\"The greatest part of \"Twilight of the Idols\" is the chapter called \"Morality as Anti-Nature\" in which he says that all moral systems up until now, and particularly Christianity, are wrong precisely because they try to deform and reshape human nature to their own image.  For Nietzsche, the moral is the natural, but Christianity - and this is really an attack on all religious systems, though some more than others - stops being moral when it tries to impose concepts that are completely foreign to human beings like the idea that \"everyone is created the same\" or a selfless Christian charity.  Whether or not you agree with the thrust of the argument, I found the idea of moral systems as rational attempts to remold nature an interesting one.  Of course, people jump on these passages to try to make him look like some kind of nihilist or immoralist, when nothing could be further from the truth.  He simply wants the principles and drives of human nature to inform ethical systems, not something foreign to them.  Freud may have picked up on this, admitting as he did a great debt to Nietzsche.  \"The Anti-Christ\" goes on to attack what I would call religious psychology, and especially the moral precepts of Christianity.If you haven\\'t read Nietzsche and have some sort of caricature of what he says in your head, start with this book, probably one of his most readable, which is ironic when considered in the light of his mental breakdown immediately thereafter.  His attacks are never the ones you hear from atheists these days, that \"the idea of God is irrational\" or \"we have no scientific evidence for such a being.\"  His criticisms are fresh and invigorating, including accusations that the apostle Paul distorted Christ\\'s message beyond measure and that Christianity focuses on another world essentially devaluing this one.  Again, this isn\\'t about agreement or disagreement with his basic assertions.  (Some of the people on whom he had the biggest influence fundamentally disagreed with what he said.)  It\\'s the punch that he packs while delivering them.  There was a reason why he subtitled the book \"Wie man mit dem Hammer philosophiert\" (\"How to Philosophize with a Hammer\").Other than Nietzsche\\'s writing itself, some of the most impressive things about him are the downright preposterousness of the criticisms that people levy against him, the sheer width and breadth of intellectual laziness with which people read him.  Just from reading a small sampling of the reviews posted on this book alone, there are accusations of him \"deriding self-control\" and being \"obnoxiously right-wing,\" the first a willful misreading, the second a risible attempt to foist a set of anachronistic political opinions on the ideas of a man who was hugely contemptuous of the German politics of his own day, left and right alike.  Those who are trying to discover their token protofascist in Nietzsche would do better to look elsewhere, especially at his contemporaries Paul de Lagarde, Julius Langbehn, and Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, all of whose ideas make Nietzsche\\'s supposed illiberalism look like mere child\\'s play (for details, see either Fritz Stern\\'s marvelous \"The Politics of Cultural Despair\" or my review of it posted on this site).  That Nietzsche still serves as a lodestar around which people feel free to hang their own various political opinions can only be a testament to his continued cultural importance.',\n",

The only reason that I did not give it 5 is because it was hard to read the liner notes in the extra stuff because they were too small and in a bright color.

I avoided reading it for a while.  I looked at it.  I didn\\'t even bother to read the back.  I wanted to read it... but I dreaded the review that would follow if I didn\\'t like it.  Enter, this afternoon.  I was tired, didn\\'t feel well, and after making half a card before crashing, I decided to take the book and go to bed.  I read it.Now, maybe it was just the perfect day to read the story, but I liked it.  There was so much depth to each character.  That is always a difficult thing to achieve when there is a large supporting cast of characters.  If you give them too much attention, you take away from the soul of the book and leave the reader floundering from person to person.  If you don\\'t give them enough attention, the book falls flat.  This book tugs you in, fills you up, and leaves you smiling at the end.  There were times during the story that I wanted to slap every single character in it.  It ended quite satisfactorily, which is a feat in and of itself.This is one of those rare books that has a very deep undertone.  On the surface, it\\'s just a light fluffy story for a balmy spring afternoon.  However, if you immerse yourself in it, there are deep and amazing spiritual truths played out before your eyes.  Be careful... they could just change your life.  I know in a tangible way, this book changed mine.So, obviously I recommend it.',\n",

Namely, that the writer\\'s duty and privilege is \"to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past.\" And that the writer must rid his workshop of everything except \"the old verities and truths of the heart, the old universal truths lacking which any story is ephemeral and doomed -- love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice.\"What must have really motivated Edith to write the article in the first place, and which she had too much class to mention, is that Faulkner lifted these ideas for his Nobel speech, and the very words, from Edith\\'s own 1936 book \"Spokesmen for God.\"But that aside, the main point of the article is her masterful and illuminating analysis of Faulkner\\'s art and placing of it in context.  A mastery of analysis she repeats in all the writings in this collection.  For me she was one of the great teachers.

       "  'reviewText': \"I received the Bose QuiteComfort 3 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones as a gift and have been giving it a test comparision with the Sennheiser PXC250 that I already own.  Here is very short summary of the comparison thus far:Noise cancellation:Bose:  9 out of 10Senn:  8 out of 10- It appears that QC3's slightly better noise cancellation is due to the better sound isolation of the ear padding itself and not necessarily due to better noise cancellation electronics.Audio quality (low-frequency):Bose:  9 out of 10Senn:  7 out of 10- Bass quality is definitely excellent on the QC3.Audio quality (high-frequency):Bose:  5 out of 10Senn:  9 out of 10- If you listen to a higher quality audio source such as a CD, you can definitely notice the loss of definition/clarity in the Bose QC3 headset.  Senn's high-frequency response is excellent.Comment/conjecture: Because of attenuated high-frequency reponse, it appears that Bose has targeted the QC3 for the 128 Kbit MP3/WMA market.  As anyone who has tried to listen to a 128 Kbit MP3/WMA on a high-fi audio system (and was terribly disappointed in the results) can testify, having faithful high frequency reproduction of a 128 kbit source is a liability and not an advantage.  QC3 makes my MP3 player sound better than on the Sennheiser because QC3 better hides the high frequency harmonic distortions of the 128 kbit source.For me personally, the high-end clarity is much more important than the low-end response so I am disappointed in the QC3 (which is why I gave it only 3 stars).  However, for those who want great noise cancellation and listen to mostly medium quality audio sources, QC3 may be a perfect fit.\",\n",

I have hair that is about four inches longer than my shoulders and  holds a curl pretty well.I bought these curlers two weeks ago and have been using them daily. The set comes with \"8 jumbo, 6 large, 6 medium rollers\" and plastic claw clips. The rollers are not actually jumbo.large/medium: they are large/medium/small. This actually works better for me, as I already own a set of all jumbo (1.5 inch) rollers.These rollers do a good job of curling my hair, and I like the three sizes, but the unit has some serious design flaws:1) The different sized rollers have to be placed exactly the way the set comes. They will not fit ramdonly placed. It is very difficult to figure out which way they fit, and I usually have two rollers left that won\\'t fit back into the unit.2) the plastic claw clips are just useless. They can\\'t hold the weight of the two larger sized rollers -- they will only support the smallest size. I use clips from other roller sets.3) The curlers get TOO hot. I leave them out for 15 seconds to cool before I put in my hair or I risk burning my hair and scalp.4) There is no place to store the clips, and no pouch that comes with unit.I purchased this unit on Amazon for $32 and now it is down to $22.

       "  'reviewText': \"I recently read The Bridegrooms by Allison Pittman.  It's a novel about 4 sisters set in the late 1800's.  The sisters are raised by a single father, who is a doctor.  Don't worry, I didn't need to give a spoiler alert because you get this information in the first few paragraphs of the book.  After you find out the situaiton with the mother, the book quickly shoots ahead 17 years to a time when the sisters are young women.  It's a story about their lives and love and relationship.  Oh, and flirting and discovery and some confusion and hurt.Throughout the book, the women talk about their belief in and relationship to God.  As a believer and follower of God, I find myself drawn to Christian fiction.  I love a good story.  And, even though these fictional characters lived in a different time and generation, they faced some of the same challenges and relational struggles that we face even today.  They wanted happiness and love, just like women of the 21st century.I really like to read nonfiction but every once in a while I like to read something mindless and just plain entertaining.  So, if you're looking for a light-hearted story that will, at times, keep you guessing then I will suggest The Bridegrooms.  You will become involved in the lives of the sisters and maybe even develop a hope for how you want the story to end.  Without giving one thing away, I don't think you'll be disappointed.\",\n",

Somehow it seems to rob the book of its compression and  intensity-- its finality. Doyle has created a memorable set of characters.  His description of the Easter Rebellion is scintillating. The depiction of  the poverty  and desperation of the Dublin slums poignant. The life of an  IRA volunteer is unromantically and realistically portrayed in all its  bloody carnage. His language is eidetic and at times mesmerizing (which  saved the 4 stars). There seems to be a tendency, though, to present Henry  as a personna while keeping the person a mystery. Other characters are left  fustratingly oblique.  I'd  suggest that developing subsequent books around  the lives of some of the characters here-- the martyrs of Easter, the  madame, Henry's father--  would a better literary route than Henry himself,  who seems chiseled in stone rather than flesh and blood.\",\n",

Eight-year-old Vada virtually grew up overnight and raised her three younger sisters while her father lost himself in his medical practice in the basement of their home.Now, Vada is a grown woman, still making her home with her father and sisters. Her days are spent serving as an errand girl for Cleveland\\'s fledgling amateur orchestra.Dizzying change occurs the day the Brooklyn Bridegrooms come to town to play the Cleveland Spiders and a line drive wallops the head of a spectator. The fan is whisked to the Allenhouse parlor, and questions swirl about the anonymous, unconscious man.Suddenly, the subdued house is filled with visitors and Vada\\'s sisters are giddy at the bevy of possible suitors. Vada\\'s life is awakened amid the super-charged atmosphere of romantic opportunity.This book is an easy read; from the beginning, Pittman grabs your attention. If you\\'re female, that is - I don\\'t think this is a \"guy\" book by any stretch of the imagination.I found myself comparing this story to Little Women frequently. There are four sisters, one present parent, a (rather bossy) housekeeper, and close to the same time period. There were enough differences in the storyline, however, that that comparison didn\\'t arise too often.Overall, I enjoyed this book. It\\'s got its moments of humor, and moments of sadness. There\\'s just enough detail to invite the reader into the grand picture of the book without bogging one down. The personalities of the four sisters, especially, are beautifully distinctive.Ms.Pittman took, what was for me, a surprising view at the end of the book. I am still struggling with it, to be truthful - and that\\'s one of the signs of a good book for me.I would recommend this book, especially if someone wants to discuss it with me!This book was supplied by the publisher as a review copy.',\n",

As a church planter/lead pastor, I&#8217;m sensitive to buzzwords and passing fads and as a result, blew off the notion of thinking of myself as a movement leader for a while.  That stopped when I first intersected the contents of this book.  If you lead in the context of Jesus' amazing church, you are part of a movement launched by God Himself and I&#8217;m convinced it&#8217;s His desire to help you understand how to navigate well within our changing world.  If you allow the theological underpinning to concretize this and the practical experiences and tools within these pages slowly shape you, you will soon find yourself being swept away in the global movement of God.

       "  'reviewText': '\"Like a black angel of memory, almost every tale, every occurrence finds an echo inside the walls of the barrio.\"  The Barcelona Brothers (from which this quotation is drawn) tells a story of intertwined lives, of barrio residents reacting to the echo of a dramatic event that will force them to reexamine their desperate lives.The novel opens with the mother of all bar fights.  Tanveer Hussein loses.  His assailant, Epi Dalmau, flees.  Epi\\'s brother Alex, a medicated schizophrenic, witnesses the killing, as does Salva, the bar\\'s owner.  Rumors spread around the barrio about the cause and perpetrator of the assault on Tanveer, all of them wrong.  As the story progresses, glimpses of the past alternate with snatches of the present, providing clues to Epi\\'s motive for attacking Tanveer. That Tanveer deserves to die becomes increasingly apparent as his violent life is revealed, yet Epi seems an unlikely assassin.The story drifts from past to present, from one damaged character to another.  Whether they are central to the story or playing a bit part, the characters are unique and unforgettable.  Tiffany Brisette, Tanveer\\'s girlfriend, is driven by the need to feel empowered.  She thinks she can control the game when she\\'s with a man because she\\'s the only one who knows they\\'re playing a game.  Her sister Jamelia, a little slow and befuddled by life (and by far the novel\\'s sweetest character), is convinced that God will eventually punish Tiffany for being mean to everyone.  Aging part-time sex worker Roc&iacute;o Baeza just wants to stay alive while she supplements her family\\'s income.  Allawi, like barbers everywhere, is the barrio\\'s central repository of gossip.Carlos Zan&oacute;n writes with insight and sensitivity about hopeless and forgotten lives.  His characters are incapable of planning or of achieving goals because in their lives \"one thing knocks away another, like in a billiards game.\"  Their aspirations are simple -- a stable relationship, a job, a good life -- but unattainable.  Although they seem destined to make bad choices, it\\'s not clear that good choices are ever available.  They are prisoners of their own fatalism.  They live together but they are alone, \"their hearts withered by solitude.\"The barrio itself is virtually a character.  This isn\\'t the Barcelona of fashion models, art museums, and trendy tapas bars, where happy tourists play on white sand beaches.  It is a gritty place where dreams shatter like the windows of abandoned cars, a locked warehouse that isolates the poor and the mentally ill and the drug addicted, a place where the criminal underclass allies with the Arab immigrants who are shunned elsewhere.Zan&oacute;n\\'s powerful prose builds and maintains teeth-clenching tension as the story moves to a conclusion that the reader will both anticipate and dread.  It seems inevitable that at least one luckless life will end tragically, yet the final chapters leave room for the reader\\'s imagination to fill in the gaps.  Some readers will dislike the uncertainty, the feeling that the novel isn\\'t quite finished, but I appreciated the respite it offered from the sense of impending doom that pervades much of the story.Although I loved The Barcelona Brothers, I recognize that many readers will not.  If you are looking for humor and warmth, look elsewhere.  If you do not like a book unless you like the characters, if you believe fictional characters should always learn lessons or experience moral transformations, this is not the book for you.  The world doesn\\'t always work that way, and The Barcelona Brothers reflects that reality.It is a tribute to Zan&oacute;n that he made me care so much about such disagreeable people.  If, like me, you appreciate strong and uncompromising writing that examines the hearts and minds of realistic (albeit broken) characters in dark settings, you will find much to admire in The Barcelona Brothers.',\n",

They do this because these subjects allow them to not only feel \"multicultural,\" but to feel as if they are somehow saying, \"I told you so\" to American conservatives and any white citizens who might feel that racism is overblown.The fact is, racism is overblown.  Take Hurricane Katrina for instance.  African Americans and liberal whites were screaming, \"RACISM!!\" after the failure of FEMA to respond effectively to the disaster.  This argument dies when you look at FEMA\\'s response to Hurricane Andrew in 1992.  That hurricane decimated predominantly white neighborhoods in Miami to the point that the chief of Miami disaster relief, Kate Hale, said, \"Where the hell\\'s the cavalry?\"  FEMA did not respond effectively then.  In fact, they have never responded effectively to a major disaster.  But, I suppose Katrina is different, right?  Wrong.Katrina is only one example in a sea of them.  The Paula Rothenbergs of the world like to use South Africa as an example.  They claim that country came together for a national dialog and collectively eliminated Apartheid.  What they fail to acknowledge is the fact that their \"invisible racism\" is still alive an well in South Africa and always will be.  White South African shop owners still prefer white South African customers.  This will never change, no matter how many books like Rothenberg\\'s are published.There has never been a society without subtle preferences for one\\'s own race and there never will be.  As long as people like Paula continue to press white people for ever more \"progress\" on this \"invisible racism,\" they\\'ll merely push this supposed invisible-racism-free utopia further away.',\n",

The only problem I have had is the edges get a little too hot to touch if left on too long. I simply open the plastic cover on that side to cool them a bit.The set features different size curlers, for different parts of the hair. It grasps nicely (even to fine hair) and is easy to roll. It's exactly what I anticipated and is working well.For those with hard to hold hair, I recommend a spray gel beforehand to keep the curl lasting longer.\",\n",

Some reviewers take issue with its dated format. At the time the book was written and printed, it was current on the design styles, newer fabrics, how to properly sew them, etc. I also own the newer edition of this book, its not complete. It's updated with some current fabrics, clothing styles, but some of the core sewing techniques has been removed. These techniques help the reader/student figure out not only how to work on the newer fabrics, but how to resolve other sewing problems. I find that the older editions of the different sewing publications really help the willing student grow..\",\n",

He was the one guy that every girl remembers from her past.  He was the one, and even though he tore through her live like a tornado and left an aftermath of sadness and grief, she could not forget him.\"\"And even if there was a woman completely happy, isn\\'t there always a spark of curiosity that makes her wonder of the `what could have been?\\'  Doesn\\'t everyone wonder? And in Marnie\\'s case, doesn\\'t she deserve to know?\"My Review:I could tell shortly after starting this book that it was going to be an intense and emotional read.  I was moved to tears several times, yet could not stop reading.  Most of us have had at least one failed relationship that has marked us, scarred us, shaped us, or in some cases - ruined us.  It is hard not to compare subsequent relationships against \"the one\" or to wonder about the \"what ifs?\"  Our heroine suffers from personal trauma that has her conjuring up memories of her first love, which only causes her further turmoil and self-loathing.  The story goes back and forth in the timeline, but it usually correlates and ties in well due to the unresolved issues that tie in to her present day concerns.  I was engrossed in this story.  It was extremely well written, insightful, and realistic.  It brought back many memories of how youth feels... the highs, excitement of new love, sexual and personal discovery, freedom... as well as the hangovers, the idiocy, naivety, and the insecurities.  This is an exceptional book.  I find I don\\'t want to start another just yet as I feel - just a bit raw and melancholy.',\n",

I was really unimpressed-The good:The fit is comfortable- I like the noise-deadening foam that sits flat on your ears.  It feels comfortable, they're light and soft.The carrying case is pretty nice- they're very easily portable.They do a good job deadening outside noise.The bad:The sound quality is really really terrible.  Way too much low end and it's muddy and not accurate.  The mids and highs aren't accurate either- I was shocked at how awful they sounded.  I did a side by side comparison with a pair of Sennheiser HD595s (retail $180) and a pair of Sennheiser PXC250 noise-cancelling headphones (got refurbed for $90.)  The 595s blew the QC3's away (which isn't a shock as they are really great), but the real shock was the PXC250s!  They provided a much fuller, deeper, more accurate sound than the QC3s and it wasn't even close.  I decided to ask my father (who really knows nothing about audio or headphones) to do the same side-by-side comparison without telling him what I thought, and he agreed as well and he didn't think it was close.This was a big surprise to me- I have heard some 'audio elitists' complain about Bose sound quality, but I really thought at a retail price of $350 they wouldn't sound like garbage.My recommendation is to take that $350 you'd spend on these and buy the Senny 595s for $180 (great for home listening, but not noise cancelling and not in public), the PXC 250s for $90(pretty good noise cancelling, way better sound quality) and a little dot tube amp for $80 or so.  All those combined equals the price of this set of headphones.  It's a much more functional, better sounding setup than you will get with the QC3s.Again, I'm not an audio snob, but I know what sounds good.  These sound terrible.\",\n",

During one of Kei\\'s conversations with Kanzaki, we learn a little more about what happened after the accident that involved Suwa and Kei.  Kei also throws a surprise birthday party for Kanzaki.  Next is the school athletic meet, where, unbeknownst to Kei, Suwa is visiting Saito and watching the events.  This is followed by Kanzaki discovering that Suwa has dropped by his apartment for an unexpected visit.  Kanzaki ends up having to keep that visit a secret from Kei, which starts to add some tension and strain for Kanzaki to deal with.About halfway through this volume, six months have progressed since the beginning of the series.  Hidaka has made some subtle changes in the designs of some of the teenage characters to reflect this passage of time.  Outside of that, though, this volume has the look a reader has come to expect from this series.  I also noticed that Hidaka also seems to be relying on some of the manga tropes that she had really backed off on in Volume 3.  However, how Hidaka utilizes these tropes really helps to emphasize what\\'s going on.  One of my favorites is how Hidaka uses a lightning background, combined with the expressions on the faces of Shinogu and Rion, to depict how much they dislike each other when they first encounter each other at the beginning of this volume.What I\\'ve really been appreciating about Hidaka\\'s writing style is that she reveals just enough new information in each volume of the series to keep the reader satisfied, yet leaves enough details unanswered to make the reader want to read more to find out what other information will be revealed in the next volume.  In a lot of ways, it\\'s like peeling away the layers of an onion; just as you peel away one layer, you discover there\\'s a new layer waiting to be peeled back.  When I reached the end  of this volume, I really wanted to be able to read Volume 5 to find out what information, twists, and turns will be revealed.  If you\\'ve read and enjoyed the previous three volumes of Tears of a Lamb, then I think you will enjoy this volume as well.Tears of a Lamb is rated \"T\" for teens.I wrote this review after my older daughter checked out a copy of this manga volume through the King County Library System.',\n",

Not only did she lose a mother that night, but her father went somewhere else emotionally, leaving eight-year-old Vada to discover she had become the mother hen of a brood of sisters, Hazel is the independent suffragette who just wants to be loved. Althea was struck silent at the betrayal of her mother and only speaks in poetry or with her eyes. Lissette is a beautiful bit of fluff who pouts and flounces her way through the novel and into most eligible young mens' hearts.The plot points are abundant. Baseball players, an unconscious man, a suitor a bit too starchy and a couple others way too seductive. Themes of infidelity, faith quakes, insecurities and sibling rivalries flare up on a regular basis. Romance blooms in every chapter. This is not my favorite Allison Pittman novel but it was an enjoyable read.Fans of romance, sister stories and drama will want to look further into the Bridegrooms. .\",\n",

This was ok, the premis of a second-hand pram which goes on to haunt the purchaser was compelling, so I bought the book and continued reading.  It soon became clear that this author has a long way to go before she is able to create characters who are more than merely one-dimensional.  There was no depth to any of the people portrayed, the writing style was immature, I was unable to picture the scenes or people, develop an understanding or even care about the characters, there was simply no substance at all.  I did persevere right to the end, which was also massively disappointing, and deleted the book from my kindle.  I will never read it again, not recommending any one else do.  Very sorry to say this.

But it is especially useful to the Jew who either a)doesn't understand the role Jews played in History, or b)the Jew that has specific questions about the religion that were never really answered fully by any other book. This book answers questions regarding the many Jewish holidays, why we don't believe that Jesus is the son of G-d, why do bad things happen to good people (was G-d really there for us during the Holocaust?), and definitions and meanings of hundreds of Jewish items and customs that many of us use and follow, but never really understood the deeper meaning behind them.

       "  'reviewText': \"My son is 16 months old, he's a preemie so it's talking him a little longer to walk on his own but he loves to walk assisted (him grabbing my hand). Helping him walk was a back killer and he was reluctant to walk on his own and only wanted to walk with me holding his hand. He would walk a couple of steps when I put him against a wall but only for a few times then he got angry and wanted me to help him walk. So I thought this product would help him get his confidence back in walking on his own. At first he didn't like it at all but after a couple of minutes seen to enjoy it due to having more freedom with his hands. He could now grab things with both hands. He's still wobbly walking hopefully in due time he will begin to walk on his own. The only negative thing I would say about this product is that it rides up on his armpits but I do try to secure it further down so it doesn't ride up as much.\",\n",

Recounting things that her husband has told her just makes the reader want to push the author out of the way and let Billy tell the story himself.

Love the snaps instead of buttons.  The velcro logo tab on the left chest is perfect for hooking on your sunglasses. The white and yellow colors are a bit sheer so the white pocket mesh is visible through the material so I'd suggest wearing a tank under these colors for a smoother look.  I normally wear petite shirts so the length is just a bit long on me.  The material is delicate so be sure not to rub up against anything rough or it will snag.

There\\'s no better way to play the great classic game of Scrabble than on a computer....no lost tiles to deal with; no tiles to shuffle; no scorekeeping difficulties. All of this is done for you with the CD-ROM version of Scrabble!Plus -- The dictionary function is a very nice feature to have (although some of the definitions provided for certain words are hilariously strange and obtuse).This CD-ROM game offers up good graphics, background options, and sound effects as well.On a bit of a negative note, I feel that \"Maven\" has a distinct advantage over the average Scrabble participant, in that Maven ALWAYS knows those big, long, oddball-type words that you and I would never even consider plopping down. But, even so, it\\'s fun when you can beat Maven, especially when your computerized opponent is set at a \"high skill\" level.So, if you enjoy playing word games on your computer, \"Scrabble 2\" is a very good choice for sure.And always remember, Scrabble-philes, \"qwerty\" IS a valid word!

On the first unit, that washer protruded and kept the end from being inserted into the follow focus.  Also, the first unit had a fairly heavily abraded plastic sheathing. It would still have operated, if not for the other problem, but pretty sloppy. The packaging wasn't damaged at all, so someone placed it in a package with very apparent damage.Also, the shipping was really slow. I don't recall precisely, but perhaps a few weeks or more. I've ordered other products to be shipped from China that were received quite promptly.I sent the company detailed photos and they politely agreed to send a replacement. They didn't require the original unit to be returned. The replacement unit is fine. I'd probably have given it a rating of 4 stars, but for the poor quality control.

(Check out Fireside's large print Librosario for that; it is what I would call &#34;comfortable,&#34; rather than &#34;large print.&#34;) There is a decent basic Catholic dictionary, but no maps at all. Since it is a NABRE it does come with the usual hit-or-miss notes, which are collected at the end of each book. It is too big to cart around, and too nice to risk dings. Despite its humongous size, the font seems on the small side, but I read two chapters of Isaiah today without problem. It is in an unusual three-column layout. Between that, the small font and large pages, the book of Ruth is only two pages! (Coincidentally, I found a 1961 Bible where we had RCIA class tonight, and it had the same layout.) The paper is real, thick, gilt edge book paper, so you don't have to worry about thin Bible pages. It has two ribbons, which is really nice. One for your couple study and one for your personal reading.It comes in a substantial slip cover with St. Peters stamped in gold. The cover is beautiful, thankfully not the Jesus portrait so often found on family Bibles. Just a striking red cross with a gold tile design near the edges of the cover. The spine is decorated, and tastefully incorporates the NABRE trademark. Although I believe it is bound with glue, there are ridges to suggest an heirloom. It looks and feels impressive, and Catholic.There are lovely color sections on The Mass (without one instance of the word &#34;sacrifice,&#34; unless I overlooked it); Parenting; Grief and The Vatican; as well as children's stories and activities for Christmas. There is the customary portrait of the reigning Bishop of Rome, and a list of all his predecessors. The various sections provide appropriate traditional and modern prayers, which I thought was nice. There is an excellent family record section, with places for eight kids. (This is a Catholic Bible, after all.) It goes back to your great -grandparents, and also has lines for things like military service, organizations (say, Benedictine oblates), and even papal audiences! It is so well done I'm inspired to fill it out, once I figure out how to write on slick paper without making a mess.Bibles like this are more likely to be owned than read, which is somewhat of a shame. I would guess most are purchased as gifts for parents or grandparents. (I received mine as a gift.) But it shall rest next to my favorite chair and be employed in daily lectio divina. It's just too nice to put away. There's just something about turning the pages of a large, beautiful book. Even better when it's Holy Scripture.So, in conclusion, it's a really big, very beautiful Catholic Family Bible suitable for devotional reading unless larger print is necessary. The extra material is more &#34;fluffy&#34; than scholarly, but of decent quality. Any Catholic adult should be pleased to receive it as a gift, and proud to display it in their home. The color sections are all useful in the family setting.St. Corbinian's Bear -- see you at my blog\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"We recently bought this for our 5 year old's birthday party. I was a bit nervous that it would be cheaply made & possibly break first time out of the box (especially due to some of the reviews). I will say - it had a noticeable small hole in the front that I could hear hissing when we first inflated it. It was easily mended with needle & thread. Since then we have used it multiple times with lots of young kids - with no leak (knock on wood). Our son loves it! Our 2 year old girl enjoys splashing around in the pool too & sitting under the shower.It is a little daunting to put away so I leave that to my husband. We hang it from a tree using a pulley system to let it dry (I'm not strong enough to do that alone). After it's dry we shove it back into the bag.*We also purchased this from Kohls on sale for closer to $200.\",\n",
