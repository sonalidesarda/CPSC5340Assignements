Whether this is your first experience with Salome or if you are already a dyed-in-the-wool Strauss fan, this Salome is for you!<br />Why?  As 
other reviews have mentioned, Teresa Stratas is beautiful and perfect for the role, and she remains totally involved in the action through the 
entire opera.<br /><br />Also, Astrid Varnay is the quintessential Herodias, a "painted queen" who is desperately clinging to her control over 
her husband and will use anything--even her own daughter to manipulate the man.  Her diabolical laughter resounds as pure evil.<br /><br />Karl 
Bohm is the greatest Strauss conductor, and he shows it here, letting Strauss' chords rise just as powerfully as the composer would wish.  Bernd 
Weikl's strong voice of a prophet is perfect for the role of Jochanaan, and his looks complement the descriptions that Salome makes of him.<br 
/><br />But what really makes this Salome a "must" for you, is that this great one-act opera was produced as a film.  This allows the camera to 
go in close on the players in this psychologically tormenting story.  It actually helps us understand the interplay of all the characters as the 
camera watches their reaction to each other. Recordings, or even  live on-stage performances do not allow you to watch some of the reactions that 
are so important in a psychological drama such as this.<br /><br />Money was not spared in the costuming and staging, which let you feel as if 
you're looking right at the Judea of Herod's time.<br /><br />The director (Gotz Friedrich) has also frequently placed Salome and her mother 
side-by-side, so that we can compare their reactions to Herod.  It is a lesson in acting, to watch Herodias (Astrid Varnay) in her reactions to 
each sequence of Salome's dance.  Even the shocking old queen can be shocked.<br /><br />Yes, the "Dance of the Seven Veils" is perfect, but 
seeing Stratas lithely and gracefully moving around the stage is certainly just what Strauss intended for his prima donna, whom Herod calls "her 
mother's child."<br />At the end, we find that Herod, Herodias, and Salome all end up being deliciously repulsive, yet fascinating.
