I'm sorry to be such a Scrooge with Christmas rapidly approaching, but while watching Far From Home- The Adventures of Yellow Dog tonight, it 
sort of struck me as boring.  I was expecting a family-oriented film that focuses on a teenager and his dog struggling to make it after a 
terrible boat accident leaves them stranded along the rocky coasts of British Columbia, and the film delivers in that respect but... it just 
*barely* delivers.<br /><br />The entire presentation feels really bloated and exaggerated to me which is typical of early to mid 90's adventure 
films.  A film that certainly LOOKS really good and I imagine a lot of time was devoted to making it, and I remember back in the mid 90's how 
these type of animal movies won the hearts of everyone who had an affection for them, but as the years pass and technology and filmmaking 
changes, I find a movie like this just isn't very fun to watch anymore.<br /><br />I can't remember if this film was produce by Disney but it 
definitely *feels* like it was.  My biggest problem is that the actual survival story between the teenager and his dog was incredibly shallow.<br 
/><br />Yes they collect bugs, kill animals when they get hungry enough, encounter dangerous wildlife animals such as wolves and wild cats, 
but... it's just not enough.  These segments feel undeveloped and uncreative.  It's just not enough entertainment and doesn't offer a darn thing 
as far as originality is concerned either.  It's completely missing anything TRULY enticing.<br /><br />Yes, the parents are worried that their 
teenage boy is missing.  Interesting though that it never seemed to cross the mind of either those searching for the boy or his parents (with the 
exception of one scene) that he might be dead.  It was also strange how it was just assumed the boy would make it on land.  I'd be flying planes 
over the ocean first.<br /><br />If that was MY son out there missing in the woods, you better believe I'd fear the worst.  Granted, there was 
one really good emotional segment where the father looks into a mirror and cries his eyes out while his wife comforts him, but eh... that was 
just one moment of sincerity surrounded by a subtle belief that the boys life was never *truly* in danger.  Not very appealing or accurate 
storytelling.<br /><br />The fact the film is barely 75 minutes long is another problem, and even though everyone loves the dramatic and touching 
ending, I've seen better.  Actually had the entire movie been dramatic and memorable like the ending, it would have been even better.<br /><br 
/>Personally I feel Homeward Bound is a LOT better because that movie utilizes not just a compelling story of animal survival, but humor as 
well.  A much better movie than this one.
