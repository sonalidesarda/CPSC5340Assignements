Most people have not heard of this movie, or would read it's professional reviews and skip it, which is a shame.  You probably can figure out the 
whole storyline within the first few minutes, but the way they get to it is not exactly the way you think it will be.  Tim Allen is GREAT in 
this, and I put that in capital letters for a reason.  He plays this role exactly how it should be played, and he is not anywhere close to Tim 
the Tool Man Taylor like you may be thinking.  Every role in this movie is played exactly as it should be, from the slimy boss to the has-been 
action star, the ex-wife who starts wondering why she left Joe to begin with, and the daughter who hides her talent so she doesn't stand out in 
the crowd.  A great movie that everybody should at least give a chance.<br /><br />The seller does an excellent job in refinishing the DVD, and 
you can't beat the price.  It literally looked brand new.
