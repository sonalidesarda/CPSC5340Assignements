You don't have to own a Yellow Lab to absolutley love this movie, but true dog lovers will find it irrestible. A young boy takes in a lost Yellow 
lab, and despite his parents reservations allow him to keep the dog. The boy and the dog become very close and forge a bond that is put to the 
test when they are lost in boat accident and end up stranded on a remote island. The dog stays by the young boy's side as they struggle to 
survive, find food, and battle a pack of wolves. All this happens while his parents and the coast guard desperately search for him.<br /><br /> 
After many weeks pass the Coast Guard believes they may never be found, but the dog and the boy do survive as they gain strength through each 
others love and devotion. It has an unusual ending, which I don't want to spoil, but Yellow Dog is one movie, although simple in structure, that 
really captures the true relationship that a boy and a dog can have that transcends even human friendships.
