As I stated in my reviews for Doo Wop 50 and Doo Wop 51, both they and this show are extremely outstanding in nearly every way.  Frankly, I 
thought Little Richard's appearance was a little pointless, and while I enjoyed Frankie Ford's Sea Cruise, both of these performances seemed a 
little out of place on this show.  It seemed like Lou Christie was straining to hit the high notes at times, but hit them he did. I was 
especially impressed with Little Anthony and the Imperials acappella performance of "Two Kinds of People in the World", and Jay Black and the 
Americans' performance of Cara Mia (at the very respectable age of 62) is enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up every time 
you watch it.  I wonder why the back up group Pure Gold, which appears on all three shows, doesn't get a performance of their own, because they 
are good.  This is an excellent addition to anyone's DVD library.  Some notes here:  all three of these shows have behind the scenes interviews 
with various performers.  There are five or six on Doo Wop 50, ten on Doo Wop 51, and ten or twelve on this one, but this is the only one of the 
three to have bonus tracks of performances, of which there are four.  There is a listing of the tracks on the back of the DVD case, but whoever 
designed that put them in random order, not as they appear on the DVD.  The performance listing as it appears on the DVD is as follows:<br /><br
