I'm not a TIm Allen fan, I had only watched GALAXY QUEST before (and enjoyed it a lot!).<p>JOE SOMEBODY is a very good movie. I agree it's not a 
straight forward comedy, not at all. I'd even say that the moments to really laugh are very rare indeed.<p>But the fact is that all the 
supporting actors are in top form, playing their roles with energy and enthusiasm, even the guys that plays Allen's new friends in the squash and 
karaoke scenes.<p>I think the movie generated some bad reviews because it oscilates dangerously between comedy and real drama (divorced parents, 
unhappy mother, inescrupulous boss. Well, for me it worked. I just spent one and a half enjoyable hours watching it.
