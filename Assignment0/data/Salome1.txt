It's high time this fabulous film of Salome became available on DVD and I'm ordering it as soon as it's available on July 7th.  It's like diving 
into a feast of depravity.  Teresa Stratas, who would never have been able to undertake this great role in a staged production in one evening, 
nevertheless creates a filmed Salome that is pretty close to the absolute ideal.  Beautiful, sexy, and catlike, she brings the depraved Princess 
of Judea to life as no other.  As noted earlier, she lacked the sheer vocal power to bring this opera to life in the theatre, but in a film, with 
microphones, she comes across with aces to spare.  While she pretty much is the whole show, Astrid Varnay, herself a great artist, comes across 
as a beast-gorgon Herodias, whose own youthful sexual depravity now shows only in her distorted reptile-like face.  Her voice is in tatters, but 
it matters little in a role like this.  Her contribution to the success of this project is immeasurable.  The color is vivid, the location shots 
realistic ------ and if I'm rambling on about this, it's only because it's all so scary and fun.  Bohm was the greatest Strauss conductor of his 
time, and he brings the shattering music to the fore as only he could.  Buy it!!!!!!!!!
