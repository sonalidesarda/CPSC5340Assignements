You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this film.  This is one of those rare movies that both kids and adults can enjoy.  It has something for 
everyone.  Lots of clever situation comedy embedded in this coming-of-age wilderness drama.  A few scary moments for the young ones, but nothing 
they can't handle.  A few sprinkles of romance.  Lots of dog-boy bonding.  The ending is predictable for all but the very young, but delightful 
nonetheless.  Best of all, it's just a delightful movie free of violence, car chases, shoot-outs and antagonists!  This movie was engaging from 
start to finish.  On par with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065V3A">The Journey of Natty Gann</a> and <a
