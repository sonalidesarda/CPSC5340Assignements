I saw this production on TV many years ago and thought then that it was really good, I have now changed my mind, it is brilliant, although Teresa 
Stratas probably could not have sung the role on stage she excels here, her acting, dancing and singing is superb, is there any end to this 
womans talent? the rest of the cast is so well made that this is a masterpiece, the great Astrid Varnay is well cast here, vocally she is well 
past her prime but her experience in opera makes her the ideal Herodias. I have a number of performances with Stratas including Nedda and 
Violetta in La Traviata and she never puts a foot wrong no matter what she is doing. If you want Salome this has to be the only way to go. 
Brilliant, tense, sexy and overall frightening performance from Teresa Stratas, that is exactly what Salome should be. Karl Bohm's control of the 
orchestra is magnificent, but then this is the great Karl Bohm so you don't expect anything less.
