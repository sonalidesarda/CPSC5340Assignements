Absolutely smashing! Apart from the great set design by Friedrich it is the casting that makes this production a masterpiece. While many have 
commented on the obvious excellence of the acting/singing performance of Stratas, I think Weikl makes a great Jochanaan - the voice, the 
presence, the look. Salome is right to be terrified of him, the references she makes to his pale body, his hair and then his mouth are all 
perfectly apt.<br />Herod is perfectly decadent while Herodias is a complete wreck of a woman, in essence everything is as it should be. Even 
Narroboth is spot on - he looks like the typical Roman fool ready to die on his own sword!<br /><br />Stratas's acting is incredible. I have 
never seen anything like it in opera in fact. I almost wonder if she overdoes it and plays Salome as almost too human where in fact she might be 
interpreted as being colder, less prone to expressions and feelings of fear than she might outwardly, at times, profess. I think it may be a 
matter of taste though and I was perfectly happy with this expressive and nuanced performance.<br /><br />This is among my very favourite opera 
dvds.
