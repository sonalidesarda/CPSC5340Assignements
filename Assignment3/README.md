Assignment 3 â€“ Text Classification

I worked on text classification tasks. The goal was to predict the category of a product based on the available information from its product record and reviews.

I was provided with a labeled training set consisting of product and review information for 1500 products. Each product was labeled with one of the following categories: Books, Movies & TV, or Music.

The assignment had two parts: delivering the classifier and documenting the research conducted to select the best model.

For the classifier, I received a "labeled training set" consisting of a products file and a reviews file, following the same format as the previous assignment. In the products file, all products belonged to one of the three categories mentioned earlier, and the reviews file contained reviews associated with the products listed in the product file. Notably, most fields in the products file were removed, except for the ASIN, price, and category.

I developed a classifier that took two files of labeled test data as input and produced classifications for those records. The assignment emphasized exploring, evaluating, and documenting the choices made during the classifier's development to create the "best" model.

The assignment was divided into two parts. In the first part, I implemented code to train the model and preprocess the test data. Afterward, I answered questions regarding the experiments conducted and the decisions made while building the "best" model.
